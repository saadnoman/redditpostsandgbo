2015-05-03 16:11:30,1,0,1,Penguins of Madagascar,I went to the cinema to see Penguins of Madagascar this morning and its fantastic Plenty of comedy aimed at both kids and adults and for only 150 too
2015-05-07 05:09:24,2,0,2,Penguins of Madagascar,Hopefully they can get their own Penguins of Madagascaresque spinoff
2015-05-10 20:30:15,1,0,1,Penguins of Madagascar,I watched penguins of Madagascar and it was one of the best animated films I have seen in a couple of years It was funny smart and brilliantly voice acted
2015-05-15 03:14:41,0,0,0,Penguins of Madagascar,Watch the Penguins of Madagascar TV basically the same thing
2015-05-15 03:49:45,1,0,1,Penguins of Madagascar,Not sure from a tech point of view but I feel like Dreamworks design and animated worlds are miles ahead of Pixar They create a lot more creative locations buildings vehicles etc then Pixar because unlike Pixar they are less grounded in the real world Sure Pixar makes some amazing designs and locations but compare it to the tech of the Northwind in the Penguins of Madagascar the Dragons in How to Train your Dragon the alien ships in Home and Monsters vs Aliens etc Design wise Dreamworks has everyone beat
2015-05-03 17:28:34,1,0,1,Child 44,Child 44 Read the books and it reads very cinematically all they had to do was transfer words into film
2015-05-03 20:41:36,4,0,4,Child 44,Child 44
2015-05-04 13:09:59,1,0,1,Child 44,Most recently Child 44 The performances were good but the whole thing just dragged on for too long and despite there being several plot lines with a lot happening barely any of it was interesting I kind of regret staying through the whole thing
2015-05-04 20:24:20,3,0,3,Child 44,Child 44 was shit though I love Tom Hardy but he needs better roles Im so sick of him being the gruff underdog Hes a FANTASTIC actor he could be anything you wanted he should be done playing the same ForrestLeoMax bullshit anti hero role More Stuart A Life Backwards More campy Bronsonlike stuff
2015-05-04 20:35:05,2,0,2,Child 44,I wouldnt say Child 44 was shit but it wasnt great for sure Locke showed off his talent Legend looks great and Rocketman will definitely be far off from his other roles
2015-05-06 03:18:40,1,0,1,Child 44,Curious to see his Russian in Child 44 Not curious enough to actually watch the movie though
2015-05-07 13:46:47,2,0,2,Child 44,Child 44
2015-05-08 03:16:44,8,0,8,Child 44,As much as I love Tom Hardy Child 44 was a mistake
2015-05-08 06:28:11,2,0,2,Child 44,They shouldve waited to release Child 44 after Mad Max came out in order to capitalize on Tom Hardys rising stardom
2015-05-09 10:38:07,2,0,2,Child 44,I have read a lot of books and I loved the pacing and atmosphere of Child 44 Granted its not a masterpiece and the plot was rather predictable but for someone who loves historical fiction it was great But we can agree to disagree
2015-05-10 07:04:49,1,0,1,Child 44,Recently  Child 44 dragged on
2015-05-13 21:04:48,1,0,1,Child 44,Tom Hardy  Forget about Child 44 Hardy is very rarely in a bad film  Cant wait to go see Mad Max this weekend
2015-05-21 13:55:42,1,0,1,Child 44,I also enjoyed Child 44 but I might be the only person who did
2015-05-22 04:59:37,1,0,1,Child 44,Child 44 might fit that bill but not many have seen it and I cant find it in theaters anymore I havent seen it either but I read the book Kingsman is still in theaters but doesnt quite fit well with the other movies you listed Maybe Furious 7 but that also doesnt quite fit But if its not these then I probably dont know about it
2015-05-29 15:22:18,149,0,149,Child 44,There was a similar article a few months ago about Child 44 and how it bombed even though it was a nonSuperheroComic movie but it just wasnt a good movie
2015-05-29 17:16:11,2,0,2,Child 44,I said the same thing Just like Child 44 Hardy was the only thing I really liked about the films Throw in Dan Stevens as The Guest although more on the sociopath side

2015-05-01 22:21:47,1,0,1,True Story,This is only a problem in the MCU because of the writing and directiontone There are plenty of movies based on a true story where you know whats gonna happen but are still incredibly tense because of good directing acting and a more serious tone

2015-05-02 12:46:28,10,0,10,True Story,That was what made it so intriguing  he did not need the money It was purely ego for him In fact what is remarkable about the film is how believable they make such an absurd premise Even though they use the trick of THIS IS BASED ON A TRUE STORY the film more than lives up to that truth in a fictional sense
2015-05-02 15:11:39,3,0,3,True Story,Valkyrie Its surprising how many people forget Valkyrie even though its a fairly recent film Its a great film full of brilliant performances by a very talented cast telling a very important mostly true story of a kind that hardly ever gets told  the struggle and bravery of good men within the Nazi party who not only realized that they were being lead by a maniac but actually tried to stop him I fully expected the Academy to throw some serious nominations its way even if the film didnt win anything
2015-05-03 01:02:16,3,0,3,True Story,Really If anything he is getting more mature with his decisions I thought True Story was really good

2015-05-04 22:44:04,2,0,2,True Story,i try to go into the movie without an opinion or an image already formed because movies based on books tend to change things not that thats bad after all it does say based on a true story sometimes this can take me out of the movie whereas if i read the book after the move it fills in gaps or subplots that i never knew existed it expands on something i already enjoyed
2015-05-05 07:20:42,1,0,1,True Story,Theyve had an attempt at the Batavia mutiny years ago but it was a low budget doco Its an unreal true story and would make an amazing feature film

2015-05-09 20:26:57,5,0,5,True Story,Based on a true story
2015-05-10 16:00:43,1,0,1,True Story,Just because its a true story doesnt make it a good story I think that movie desparately needed a plot stronger than dont die til theres a good moment to die
2015-05-11 01:23:36,67,0,67,True Story,I dont know what to tell you Everything Thats just the reaction I had towards watching the exploits of a person who is the epitome of scum I guess it hit particularly hard because its a true story

2015-05-11 14:33:02,1,0,1,True Story,So you cant tell a true story without getting an NC17 rating but you hang a naked teenaged girl upside down over a bathtub and torture her to death and masturbate in her blood and body parts and thats ok  Thanks MPAA you fucking scumbags
2015-05-11 16:35:04,1,0,1,True Story,Its very good but not great Definitely worth watching  and the sound was fantastic nominated for mixing and editing and it won one of those at the Academy awards I can understand the reticence due to the inaccuracies and it is a little insensitive to the British but its best just to look at it as what it really is narrative fiction based partially on a true story And while it may be disingenuous to present the events of the film as historical fact in this case it serves the viewer well to treat most historical films in this manner as very few war stories do not borrow aspects or facets of their allies narratives much less the oppositions It would have served the film better to have a title card up front or afterward explaining that it was based on the experiences and actions of a British naval event but its worth seeing though but primarily to appreciate what the individuals went through even if the nationality is switched for the sake of box office returns If it still bothers you you can always just think of it as another Hunt for Red October and there was another American film that came out around the same time from another countries perspective K19 The Widowmaker  which was decent U571 is worth the watch just for the sound though the low end is actually good for testing the performance of speakers or monitors

2015-05-13 14:37:58,8,0,8,True Story,Not showing that Tibet was a terrible place before the Chinese arrived is propaganda It was 10 times worse with Dalai Lama in leadership thats just a historical fact Showing Mao Zedong flying into Tibet and kicking their sand art A man who has never even been in Tibet Making Gandhi out to be a saint and the Muslims to be evil in India Its politics It is a fake picture of reality It would be the same thing if you made a movie where Israel was super good and Palestine was just terrorist and evil guys Its propaganda as millions of people watch these things and dont know about the true story Look at the guy who criticised me for not wanting the truth to be shown in the test scene He clearly thought that the scene depicted reality And that she was hired that way and that the sexism happened that way
2015-05-13 15:47:24,3,0,3,True Story,I am not confusing movies with reality A Beautiful Mind is one of the best movies ever made but he did not see imaginary things IRL he just heard imaginary things But the point was 100 correct he was actually crazy And there were no forced politics Avater has the same thing Forced politics Its not real life but it still feels silly and thats a bad thing no matter if it is based on a true story or not And a biography should also be judged by how well it portrays the man and the story If you make everything up then dont use the real characters Otherwise we will expect at least some real stories or a warning before the movie starts dont break my expectations but saying it is THE true story Either way I would rate Imitation Game 8 stars even if it was made up But being silly and feeling fake makes it worse Its like Superman turning back time Its terrible because it does not fit into the world they show us Not just because it is not real Like an action hero being shot in the head and surviving You need to follow certain guidelines you make up
2015-05-13 19:35:06,1,0,1,True Story,Thats whats so great about it and to a certain extent the whole this is a true story gag  it ties into the tone of the film and will run on for years I just wonder what Prince himself would have to say about it and how well that would go over

2015-05-17 02:36:36,1,0,1,True Story,The book Eaters of The Dead was based on a Ahmad ibn Fadlans recount of his journey north to meet the Vikings In short the first half of the movie is based on a true story where as the second half is a revised version of Beowulf So the accuracy is more than present as to what Viking traditions and practices are portrayed in the movie Then the icing on the cake is the added storycraft from Beowulf In all it is a fantastic story of mythology and nonfiction Though you would be doing yourself a disservice not reading the book

2015-05-19 10:40:27,3,0,3,True Story,Seriously though obviously I know that it is a movie I have seen plenty of based on a true story which they can put on anything so I would wager to say 99 of them arent movies and have not been affected by them in the least I didnt ask for help because I dont know it is just a movie I asked for help because this particular movie stuck with me in a way that I cant get it out of my head I like sleep I need sleep for whatever reason the premise of this movie is robbing me of it While I appreciate that you took the time out of your morning to essentially call me a dumbass Im still not quite sure why you didUnless being mean and unhelpful is what gets your rocks off in which case go you You still havent learned the difference between being clever and being an asshole

2015-05-27 00:11:16,-2,0,-2,True Story,Are you serious What is the appeal to you I find it to be an objectively terrible film The tone is awful it feels like its trying to be a Scorsese or Coen Brothers film but instead of treating the characters with some humanity its clear that the film has nothing but contempt for any of them It comes across as a bleak unfunny and ultimately mean film Not to mention the victims of what was a true story

2015-05-29 05:43:15,2,0,2,True Story,The main problem is that it is presented as a true story even though its been confirmed that Chris Kyle was a pathological liar who fabricated major portions of his autobiography  Though I guess it did make a point to acknowledge that he was an absolutely shitty person so maybe the problem is the military apologists who are too far up their ass with ideological patriotism who dont seem to realize that both the real Chris Kyle and the character in the movie were shitty people because anyone in the army must be a hero or some shit like that

2015-05-08 03:23:45,1,0,1,The D Train,The D Train has terrible trailers but the reviews I read were really positive Its more of a dramedy than the rest of your list and the trailers probably suffer from having to dance around the central twist in a way that just doesnt work

2015-05-11 16:35:04,1,0,1,'71,Its very good but not great Definitely worth watching  and the sound was fantastic nominated for mixing and editing and it won one of those at the Academy awards I can understand the reticence due to the inaccuracies and it is a little insensitive to the British but its best just to look at it as what it really is narrative fiction based partially on a true story And while it may be disingenuous to present the events of the film as historical fact in this case it serves the viewer well to treat most historical films in this manner as very few war stories do not borrow aspects or facets of their allies narratives much less the oppositions It would have served the film better to have a title card up front or afterward explaining that it was based on the experiences and actions of a British naval event but its worth seeing though but primarily to appreciate what the individuals went through even if the nationality is switched for the sake of box office returns If it still bothers you you can always just think of it as another Hunt for Red October and there was another American film that came out around the same time from another countries perspective K19 The Widowmaker  which was decent U571 is worth the watch just for the sound though the low end is actually good for testing the performance of speakers or monitors

2015-05-31 17:10:02,1,0,1,'71,The opening montage to Uphttpsyoutube1G371JiLJ7A is pretty perfect to me
2015-05-01 02:10:35,3,0,3,Furious 7,Besides the forced sub plots it was pretty decent No furious 7 but for what it was I liked it
2015-05-01 11:23:07,1,0,1,Furious 7,Furious 7 got this gross mostly because its a fun action film that appeals to a large amount of people who just want entertainment but and I hate to say this because its awful but kind of true it would only have made like 800 or 900 million if it wasnt for Paul Walkers death
2015-05-01 13:30:40,1,0,1,Furious 7,With 50 Shades American Sniper and Furious 7 in this year I believe I shall persevere
2015-05-01 13:41:49,2,0,2,Furious 7,I dont get it  Saving Private Ryan is almost 18 years old and Reservoir Dogs is 23 years old  Havent seen Furious 7 but the others are solid picks and dont really give any indication of youth
2015-05-01 13:52:02,1,0,1,Furious 7,gt End of Furious 7 was good too
2015-05-01 15:15:14,9,0,9,Furious 7,Furious 7 That ending took me by suprise Just felt so bad for Vin Deisel hearing his voice over
2015-05-01 21:21:09,1,0,1,Furious 7,They accidentally started showing Furious 7 instead of The Avengers at my theater it was pretty hilarious and so we missed all the new trailers
2015-05-01 22:56:13,1,0,1,Furious 7,Fast and furious 7 was taking it self seriously while being utterly ridiculous
2015-05-01 23:07:51,1,0,1,Furious 7,Same thing happened here in the states but it turned out that they accidentally had furious 7 playing Everyone freaked out until they fixed it
2015-05-02 03:16:54,1,0,1,Furious 7,Ive seen nothing but the first teaser so heres hoping our strategy works I had to duck my head when the played a trailer during Furious 7
2015-05-02 12:24:46,3,0,3,Furious 7,Furious 7 got me during the credits you can see that Paul Walker was trully a friend for the other members of the cast It was a great hommage
2015-05-02 14:10:45,1,0,1,Furious 7,Dude Furious 7 is at that level so I expect Ultron to surpass Furious 7
2015-05-02 14:11:53,1,0,1,Furious 7,Furious 7 is at 2 bill
2015-05-02 20:42:04,3,0,3,Furious 7,They can go watch Furious 7 again if they cant appreciate a lull in the action Sometimes a narrative needs to breath
2015-05-03 02:39:22,0,0,0,Furious 7,Nope no where close to having technology peak If tech had peaked you will never recognize something as cgi In furious 7 they couldnt recreate paul walkers face to look even 80 real
2015-05-03 04:09:35,-83,0,-83,Furious 7,Not yet but artistically it has surpassed it by a mile Furious 7 is just an action movie The Avengers The Age of Ultron is a beautiful artwork As I said somewhere else while the earlier Marvel films are just portraits this film is more abstract It throws all the previous characters together like a Jackson Pollock which is why Whedon made the decision not to have so much exposition to fill people in you have to just run with it Critics have complained about it but thats simply nonsense theyre simply not the right audience for Marvel and dont understand that they fit into the whole cinematic universe Critics complaints are like the complaints of children complaining about now understanding a Picasso  they simply dont have the right contextual and artistic background to appreciate it

2015-05-03 09:27:42,1,0,1,Furious 7,Star Wars The Force Awakens Fast and Furious 7 Mission Impossible  4 All filmed in Dubai UAE
2015-05-03 09:56:12,2,0,2,Furious 7,Ugh bunch of lame one liners ala furious 7 and way to much filler that didnt develop anything Even the action scene sucked Shit even the cg looked so fake at times
2015-05-03 11:08:25,-2,0,-2,Furious 7,To me Fast and Furious 7 is one of the best action movies Ive ever seen i havent seen Avengers 2 yet but it far surpasses the first For a start the characters actually give a shit about each other and they have far more diversity to them than tall buff white guy who is very manly As good as the CGI was FF7 had far more memorable action sequences The camera flip when Johnson does the Rock Bottom Walker running up the falling bus and catching onto Rodriguezs car spoiler or the flying cars among many others Even on technical levels the movies surpasses the Avengers I have 8 categories that I rate movies on and FF7 scored and average of 8 while Avengers got 69
2015-05-03 13:26:53,2,0,2,Furious 7,I mean it isnt usually okay and when I saw Furious 7 I had to say something to a couple guys chatting away But this was more just super enthusiastic comic fans unable to contain hype levels So sine reactions got uttered but there wasnt likeconversations happening I actually feel like geeking out during opening night is part of the Marvel movie experience
2015-05-03 18:35:29,24,0,24,Furious 7,More noteworthy  it pushed the expected No 2 Furious 7 to No 3
2015-05-03 19:07:03,5,0,5,Furious 7,What would be amusing  is if its final worldwide gross comes out to be less than Furious 7
2015-05-03 19:10:21,10,0,10,Furious 7,Furious 7 actually has a shot at surpassing Avengers to become the 3rd highest grossing movie everHow about that
2015-05-03 21:49:41,12,0,12,Furious 7,It might really do it It has 90 million to go before it does it made 97 million these last seven days and Age of Ultron doesnt open in China until May 12th which means that Furious 7 will probably continue to dominate the box office there until that date
2015-05-03 22:39:03,1,0,1,Furious 7,It beats Furious 7 opening weekend numbers by over 40 million
2015-05-04 04:22:31,5,0,5,Furious 7,Furious 7 wasnt in 3D though Attendance was probably pretty close
2015-05-04 06:13:48,1,0,1,Furious 7,Who was the star of the movie Furious 7 Only Paul Walker Vin Diesel Michelle Rodriguez Don Johnson name will cease to be Aston Martin DB Nine Mercedes Benz Three BMW Dodge Charger  The names are left out and why Fabulousshiny glaring of these cars is less than the exponent of the stars According to many car is the main attraction of this photo in one episode  If so lets get acquainted with Dennis myakarthira Furious Seven film starcars getup or makeup artist can say him Mill opened he placed it on the odd then that go all speed Dennis says In just three months more than three hundred has to offer vehicle delivery Did not get chance to spread all colors
2015-05-04 08:32:19,1,0,1,Furious 7,Fast and Furious 7
2015-05-04 10:37:58,5,0,5,Furious 7,Yeah I also love the FampF movies but I think Furious 7 was the perfect moment for the franchise to end on a high point Clearly with over 1 billion fresh dollars in its pockets Universal doesnt think the same way I hope they pull this off once again with Furious 8
2015-05-04 10:55:34,2,0,2,Furious 7,Im not sure that I agree that Vin Diesel is box office gold even if his most recent movies Guardians of the Galaxy and Furious 7 were huge hits because there was a time when Keira Knightley could claim to be box office gold for being in 2 of the highestgrossing movies of all time Star Wars episode 1 and Pirates of the Caribbean   Then she starred in Domino and once the Pirates franchise ended shes only been in movies that nobody has seen like Seeking a Friend for the End of the World which is actually pretty good
2015-05-04 20:50:46,1,0,1,Furious 7,Based on China alone there is little doubt that it passes the original And Furious 7
2015-05-05 01:42:51,1,0,1,Furious 7,Too early to tell Probably nothing will get a serious Oscar nod thats been released so far besides for Best Special effects AoU Furious 7 But we already know Star Wars is gonna win that category
2015-05-05 03:46:12,1,0,1,Furious 7,It definitely wont make less than the first Avengers in China but it would be shocking if it earned more than Furious 7 Id be kind of surprised if it even broke 200MM again in China
2015-05-05 06:45:16,2,0,2,Furious 7,Yeah now I will admit that hype for big films always get to me and I jump on board But I never end up like them 100Furious 7 has a weak 3rd actAvengers 2 is a beautiful messetcbut I always love a good emotion driven film with great plot and character I dont mind Ex Machina Unfriended or It Follows these are just recent good  excellent experiences but thise much more fulfilling I want to see something great and remember it I dont want to pay to see something explode fly joke explode explode cliffhang Its borderline satisfying and boring but forgetton the next day It is the Oscar season and film festival films that make me happy I can kind if see myself in Phoenixs characterfresh off of a relationship and open to different options whether its attention love just whatever He gave his all just like a regular relationship but those damn insecurities would pop up at times and it was just hard to watch and beautiful to see that
2015-05-05 07:02:37,1,0,1,Furious 7,do you really need context to watch these movies i watched furious 7 without having seen the others and i dont feel like i was missing anything
2015-05-05 12:33:48,3,0,3,Furious 7,Fast 5 Furious 7 I havent seen 6 yet John Wick The Muppets Expendables 1 and 2 not top quality or anything but you did say FUN Men in Black 3 etc
2015-05-05 12:45:58,1,0,1,Furious 7,Furious 7 definitely my favorite so far it was just such a feel good movie
2015-05-05 14:15:28,1,0,1,Furious 7,What about Furious 7 for effects as well

2015-05-05 14:56:02,1,0,1,Furious 7,My friends words after watching Furious 7 The movie was a piece of crap it was awesome
2015-05-05 17:09:30,2,0,2,Furious 7,In other news Furious 7 is 90 million dollars from beating Avengers after 1 month in theaters
2015-05-05 17:17:47,0,0,0,Furious 7,No hyperbole Furious 7 is one of the worst movies I have ever seen
2015-05-05 17:23:58,1,0,1,Furious 7,Man of Steel and Furious 7 I didnt hate Furious 7 but as a fan of the series I thought it was a bad movie and I dont get why everyone is acting like its the best in the series
2015-05-05 18:20:37,1,0,1,Furious 7,I enjoyed Six too but felt that it careened too far into the absurd I remember feeling uncomfortable and worn out with how long the runway scene went on even after the laughable Gina Carano plot twist Furious 7 didnt really measure up to Fast Five for me but it was a much better paced film than Six
2015-05-05 23:49:18,1,0,1,Furious 7,Man Ive been inactive this year Ive only seen five 2015 movies Avengers Furious 7 Taken 3 50 Shades and Hot Tub Time Machine I guess I rate them in that order but only 2 of them are actually good
2015-05-06 01:29:21,4,0,4,Furious 7,Furious 7 I thought it was pretty bad even for a Fast and Furious movie Especially the second half
2015-05-07 11:31:01,10,0,10,Furious 7,Furious 7 was a nice surprise
2015-05-07 23:02:58,16,0,16,Furious 7,It will do alright for an RRated movie It will be way behind Furious 7 Avengers Star Wars etc Id also bet F4 will make more
2015-05-08 04:25:21,0,0,0,Furious 7,Its been like twenty years since Ive seen the movies but I cant remember the plot being that deep Did you have to watch Fast and Furious 1 through 6 in order to understand Furious 7
2015-05-08 13:29:23,15,0,15,Furious 7,Is Furious 7 the fastest film to hit 1 billion Thats insane
2015-05-08 16:17:33,145,0,145,Furious 7,Kurt Russell already had a comeback in Furious 7 he was awesome in it
2015-05-08 16:28:30,1,0,1,Furious 7,From what I saw of him in Furious 7 he can definitely carry this movie
2015-05-08 17:23:14,5,0,5,Furious 7,Just saw this post now and want to tell you that its fucking awesome Saw an early preview of the movie and it blew Age of Ultron out of the water and is what Im expecting to be the better of the summer blockbusters If youre a fan of the Mad Max films youll love it Its crazy from start to finish and the stunts are incredible and not over the topwhole movie is over the top mad max insanity but its not jumping from building to building Furious 7 style over the top Id say its a must see
2015-05-08 18:30:29,1,0,1,Furious 7,There seems to be a pattern in movies recently Fantastic 4 Fast 5 Sinister 6 Furious 7 and now The Hateful 8 Whats next The Neoflourescent 9
2015-05-08 18:57:42,2,0,2,Furious 7,Im baffled as to how you missed Furious 7
2015-05-08 19:13:50,1,0,1,Furious 7,Furious 7 and Alice in Wonderland surprise me
2015-05-08 19:49:18,4,0,4,Furious 7,He was the best part about Fast and Furious 7 Loved it when Spoilers the lights went out and he wore those night vision glasses
2015-05-08 20:03:35,1,0,1,Furious 7,Kurt Russell was just in Furious 7 The 4th highest grossing film of all time
2015-05-08 20:08:58,1,0,1,Furious 7,I havent seen Furious 7 nor Age of Extinction But I would actually say most of those movies arent that bad the only ones I dislike are  Iron Man 3 PotC On Stranger Tides Transformers 3 Star Wars 1 its the reboot right Alice in Wonderland Mixed feelings about Avatar and Titanic But I dont think many of the rest are crap is accurate
2015-05-08 20:58:46,1,0,1,Furious 7,Furious 7  Ok movie but rode a dead man past the Bill mark
2015-05-09 03:28:18,2,0,2,Furious 7,Furious 7 was pretty bad
2015-05-09 07:22:39,1,0,1,Furious 7,Furious 7 is good but I fucking despise that its the 5 movie of all time

2015-05-11 02:42:27,-16,0,-16,Furious 7,It looks like a dark and gritty Fast and Furious 7
2015-05-11 16:32:27,6,0,6,Furious 7,Corona in Fast and Furious 7 was pretty fucking blatant
2015-05-11 17:01:03,4,0,4,Furious 7,Theres a difference between a shitty movie and a movie you personally dont like Furious 7 was not a shitty movie
2015-05-11 17:30:16,4,0,4,Furious 7,Furious 7
2015-05-11 17:40:15,0,0,0,Furious 7,IMHO The dialogue of furious 7 was atrocious I dont know who wrote the script but it was terrible I didnt enjoy the movie at all because of it
2015-05-11 17:48:16,2,0,2,Furious 7,The worst in recent memory was the Corona ad in Furious 7 I almost expected Please drink responsibly to pop up on the screen
2015-05-11 17:52:26,2,0,2,Furious 7,How come Furious 7 Age of Ultron Jurassic World Spectre and Star Wars 7 are all rated PG13 Because it makes the studio so much more money from kids and families going to see it They are losing out on a ton of money by rating this film R Thats why its risky
2015-05-11 17:54:34,3,0,3,Furious 7,Furious 7
2015-05-11 18:25:53,0,0,0,Furious 7,Compare it to PG13 films like Avengers Furious 7 Guardians of the Galaxy Those movies make so much more Both films had successful books to bring crowds in Plus American Sniper had Alist talent with Eastwood and Cooper I say this because someone will say the PG13 films had massive followings Sure they did but Sniper and Grey had followings as well for the reasons listed
2015-05-11 20:58:25,2,0,2,Furious 7,Same as you I thought it would fair modestly well somewhat along the lines of Furious 7
2015-05-12 04:57:41,8,0,8,Furious 7,Furious 7 literally had Vin Diesel and Jason Statham smashing each other in the faceribsarms with pipes and wrenches Then pile driving each other into cement and cars with no broken bones or even bleeding I think theyve gone way past trying to be realistic with their fight scenes
2015-05-12 07:07:19,1,0,1,Furious 7,Furious 7 I mean I didnt even know the guy but the ending was so touching Damn Paul Walkers face Plus how hard it might have been for the cast to shoot that scene especially Vin

2015-05-12 09:27:22,271,0,271,Furious 7,Yo Furious 7 Im really happy for you Imma let you finish but
2015-05-12 10:29:42,1,0,1,Furious 7,Yeah if Furious 7 can get 1 billion then why not BvS on March I feel sorry for the other movies thats releasing on March
2015-05-12 13:59:13,1,0,1,Furious 7,Yes Its happened a few times but the most recent one was for Furious 7
2015-05-12 14:44:00,1,0,1,Furious 7,Pauls tribute in Furious 7 It was so well done and I never expected a Fast and Furious movie to make me tear up
2015-05-12 15:17:52,1,0,1,Furious 7,I liked all the racing and car stunts in Furious 7 but got really annoyed at the fast cut hand to hand combat scenes
2015-05-12 15:19:43,48,0,48,Furious 7,This reductive comparison between Furious 7 and Transformers is made daily on this subreddit and to me its astounding that people cant tell the difference Furious 7 has
2015-05-12 16:25:21,1,0,1,Furious 7,We all just did at Furious 7 I live in NYC though so every epic or long awaited flick gets an applause
2015-05-12 17:12:16,1,0,1,Furious 7,Yes furious 7 avengers marathon on launch fury matrix reloaded American sniper saving private Ryan Hugo ect
2015-05-12 17:48:19,1,0,1,Furious 7,When I just recently saw Fast and Furious 7 people clapped at the endand were sniffling too
2015-05-12 18:10:11,1,0,1,Furious 7,Really I saw furious 7 in digital is was blurry and I could barely see what was going on in action scenes Its like the framerate was lower than 24fps or something
2015-05-12 20:00:35,1,0,1,Furious 7,This one dude tried starting a slow clap at the end of Furious 7 but nobody joined him  It was hilarious
2015-05-12 21:42:16,1,0,1,Furious 7,Here where I live only once have I seen a movie where people have burst into applause The movie in question was Furious 7 just after Paul Walkers montage It started slow and kept building until everyone was clapping I then just remember the guy behind me after everyone was done say dem feels though
2015-05-12 22:36:45,1,0,1,Furious 7,I work in a movie theatre since last summer The only time Ive heard the audience clapping is at the end of Fast and Furious 7 when it says For Paul
2015-05-12 22:37:15,6,0,6,Furious 7,I think not because Avengers Age of Ultron released a week earlier on some countries so its like 17 or 18 days now Furious 7 premiered globally on April 2
2015-05-12 22:39:12,3,0,3,Furious 7,Correct Its already missed the chance to hit a billion faster than Furious 7 considering its earlier release in nonUS territories
2015-05-12 22:52:54,2,0,2,Furious 7,Umm as the others have said Furious 7 beat other titles to 1 billion mark INTERNATIONALLY in 17 daysnot worldwide Some factors are the release schedule wasnt as spread out as Avengers 2 Pauls death China always throws alot of money at the one movie every year etc avengers has hit 880 million WORLDWIDEit has only 560 million INTERNATIONALLYso it needs 440 million to even hit that 1 bil foreign club Time has expired for it to beat Furious or its predecessor but within a month mostly from China it should hit 1 billion Sorry but your facts and time schedule is very askew lol

2015-05-13 12:54:12,2,0,2,Furious 7,Fast and the Furious 7 People clapped it was very strange Its never necessary to clap at a movie
2015-05-13 13:03:04,2,0,2,Furious 7,When I saw Furious 7 after the tribute there was a roar of applause before the screen even went black to end
2015-05-13 13:05:55,1,0,1,Furious 7,i cried during Thorins Death In the battle of the five armies and the end of furious 7
2015-05-14 18:19:11,0,0,0,Furious 7,I like it Its very hard to make a movie with this amount of action and not make it boring and repetitive Theres weight to every action the motivations are believable they are not just going through the motions just for the sake of the action John Wick The Raid and Furious 7 have this problem As far as action movies go this is as good as it gets
2015-05-14 20:17:57,18,0,18,Furious 7,Furious 7 That ending man when they say goodbye to Paul Walker two cars going in two directions blew my mind I was just like wow you couldnt even tell which scenes were CGI and the emotionality of Vin Diesel cannot be understated I had just gotten my sleeve tattoo finished a Paul Walker memorial and since I was wearing my sleeveless jumpsuit to the movie others could see it and they started crying too Then I came in my pants as the credits rolled
2015-05-14 21:10:46,2,0,2,Furious 7,Honestly I find most action movie epic finales a chore to go through nowadays They stretch for too long characters trade blows and just soak them off with no consequence It feels like watching someone playing a videogame Sure in MoS it was realistic because kriptonians were impervious to damage but it was still boring In Furious 7 it was both boring and absolutely ridiculous many of the characters did things that should have killed them 5 times over and in the final fight Vin and Statham were taking blows that should have instantly shattered their bones like it was nothing
2015-05-14 21:24:12,3,0,3,Furious 7,Fast amp Furious 7
2015-05-14 21:47:00,2,0,2,Furious 7,Sorry I was just out seeing Furious 7 If you still want a change or something lemme know I actually just loved making this pic haha
2015-05-14 22:59:43,1,0,1,Furious 7,The ending to Furious 7 Interstellar
2015-05-15 03:26:47,12,0,12,Furious 7,There was a comment after Furious 7 came out along the lines of They need to have an Oscar category for stunts Well that comment applied to Fury Road 1000 Those flexible pole stunts were INSANE
2015-05-15 06:07:53,9,0,9,Furious 7,Furious 7 is childs play compared to this
2015-05-15 07:15:30,1,0,1,Furious 7,I like it Its very hard to make a movie with this amount of action and not make it boring and repetitive Theres weight to every action the motivations are believable they are not just going through the motions just for the sake of the action John Wick The Raid and Furious 7 have this problem As far as action movies go this is as good as it gets
2015-05-15 12:14:59,1,0,1,Furious 7,A lot of people went to see Fast amp Furious 7 Not many dry eyes at the end of that movie
2015-05-15 12:44:38,4,0,4,Furious 7,Heres my thoughts on why the action sequences in this movie were so powerful and so much more effective than a film like Fast amp Furious 7  When I saw FF7 last month it seemed like EVERY action sequence was totally dependent on video game physics and CGI trickery Like theres NO way in real life a guy is going to run up a bus falling off a cliff and jump and grab the spoiler of a car hanging off that cliff at the perfect time Its like all the action exists only because a filmmaker is trying to push the envelope on what CGI makes possible and Im not picking on FF7 specifically but its the poster child for what CGI action has become  Compare that with the dirty and physical action sequences from Fury Road amp its like night and day A perfect example is the sheer genius of the dudes on the giant sticks Its ridiculous in every way but its believable because its straight out of Cirque de Soleil people can DO that and then when you back that up with the detail of having giant engine blocks acting as counterweights to those poles I never once said to myself no fucking way or had to suspend belief I cant think of another movie in recent history that had that level of detail and physicality
2015-05-15 21:36:15,2,0,2,Furious 7,Between Furious 7 Avengers 2 and Mad Max my adrenal glands are completely shot
2015-05-16 02:55:38,14,0,14,Furious 7,Surprised it took this long  Many thought it would beat Furious 7
2015-05-16 03:07:12,1,0,1,Furious 7,The fanboys thought it would beat Furious 7 Everyone else was beat down for questioning the Church of Marvels always rock solid forecasts
2015-05-16 03:13:37,3,0,3,Furious 7,Its a throwback to the first movie where Vin shows Paul the classic Dodge Charger for the first time says that first sentence and explains to him why he loves racing His revising of it for Furious 7 is the franchise coming fullcircle that Dom and Brian were bonded by family and racing
2015-05-16 07:31:55,12,0,12,Furious 7,You know how trailers throw a bunch of buzzwords at you often taken out of context or are complete exaggerations Stuff like awe inspiring pulse pounding epic and so on Yeah well in this case its all completely accurate Fury Road is a goddamn ballet of vehicular carnage and is THE best movie of the summer no contest I dont care what else comes out Forget Furious 7 forget The Avengers those movies are a good time but dont have soul Fury Road has a staggering attention to detail and those practical effects make a mockery of any CGI you could throw at me Oh and what is this A slew of badass female characters who fuck shit up without it feeling insincere Yup thats there too Just stop reading this and go see this movie but make sure to bring lube Cause youre not prepared for that sweet postapocalyptic butt love
2015-05-16 15:28:45,-1,0,-1,Furious 7,Good for you Im surrounded by people who dont like to get deeper or slower than the pace of Avengers or Furious 7
2015-05-16 15:34:05,-13,0,-13,Furious 7,Dont be dishonest here The domestic gross for Furious 7 is still larger than Avengers
2015-05-16 16:22:07,11,0,11,Furious 7,EXACTLY Even the exposition from Max at the beginning was minimal which I loved Heres the movie heres some batshit crazy characters and now heres the action I think its easy enough to follow for the general populace that the people who throw their money at Furious 7 and Transformers would still enjoy this I hope I want sequels so bad
2015-05-16 18:24:21,-1,0,-1,Furious 7,Too bad its still behind Furious 7 in foreign markets
2015-05-17 04:41:42,1,0,1,Furious 7,Thank you saved me the trouble clearly stathams character was nowhere to be seen in that clip Han died from a gas explosion I see many people want to write off furious 3 because they didnt like it but i liked it And they used it in furious 7 they re wrote it im nitpicking
2015-05-17 11:17:57,-11,0,-11,Furious 7,I think youre lost Are you looking for the Furious 7 thread
2015-05-17 17:01:00,0,0,0,Furious 7,Fast and Furious 7  Theres one more ride though Looking forward to it RIP Paul Walker
2015-05-17 17:33:55,4,0,4,Furious 7,Fast and Furious 7 I dont understand why the same old generic CGI overkill stupid movie is suddenly being praised by critics and audiences alike
2015-05-17 20:13:08,4,0,4,Furious 7,I heard he was the best part of Furious 7
2015-05-17 20:28:46,11,0,11,Furious 7,well lets hope script will be a bit better this timesome lines were so cheese in furious 7
2015-05-17 20:55:05,3,0,3,Furious 7,Damn Furious 7 is about to overtake the first Avengers soon and it still has about 70 of its run left worldwide to accomplish the task
2015-05-17 20:58:23,9,0,9,Furious 7,He does kill a drone in Furious 7 which is pretty awesome
2015-05-17 20:59:22,7,0,7,Furious 7,With all the grenades he had in Furious 7 Im sure he stuck a few up his butt for later use
2015-05-17 21:39:38,25,0,25,Furious 7,I went on a binge and watched all of the movies before Furious 7 released and realized most of the main villains didnt die and were just arrested They got some strong cases for revenge
2015-05-17 23:26:20,1,0,1,Furious 7,Oh I thought given Paul Walkers death they were gonna make Furious 7 the final installment This seems like an illadvised cash grab
2015-05-18 01:35:28,2,0,2,Furious 7,Furious 7 was already a cash grab It was obvious they werent going to pull the plug on this money printer
2015-05-18 01:39:41,2,0,2,Furious 7,Furious 7 was surprisingly not canned by critics as I expected which I thought was crap Just more of the same pop without substance
2015-05-18 02:09:11,2,0,2,Furious 7,Hell to the yes I firmly believe Jurassic World is a film that will reach a billion at the box office I believe it would be 3rd highest grossing film of the yearbut that was before Furious 7 so dont think its possible now
2015-05-18 03:19:34,3,0,3,Furious 7,Man I was so happy when Kurt Russell showed up in Furious 7 None of my friends gave a shit but I was thinking of Jack Burton the whole time
2015-05-18 08:31:47,1,0,1,Furious 7,Ive heard it mentioned a couple times on podcasts that Dwayne Johnson and Vin Diesel basically HATE each other and thats why we only really saw them on screen together a couple times during Furious 7  Anyone have more backstory on this
2015-05-18 12:05:44,1,0,1,Furious 7,Seeing it tomorrow Have seen Avengers It Follows Kumiko the Treasure Hunter Ex Machina Fifty Shades of Grey Furious 7 Spongebob 2 Cinderella Chappie and Unfriended though Kingsmans still my favorite probably followed by Kumiko and Ex Machina
2015-05-18 14:21:58,-4,0,-4,Furious 7,I thought Furious 7 was load of bull Unbelievable stunts and bad stunts
2015-05-18 15:44:36,1,0,1,Furious 7,Hope they get a new director The one they had for Furious 7 had no idea how to film action scenes
2015-05-18 16:01:46,2,0,2,Furious 7,To be fair he was barely in Furious 7
2015-05-18 16:27:24,3,0,3,Furious 7,Such is life on reddit I just find it funny how we all went from loving Furious 7 to there suddenly being this backlash because of Mad Max I mean youre criticizing Furious 7 for the exact things it got praised for a month ago Im not pointing at you specifically because youre clearly well spoken and mature but Reddit is great at bandwagon jumping hence the downvotes
2015-05-18 19:21:24,1,0,1,Furious 7,Furious 7
2015-05-18 19:54:58,1,0,1,Furious 7,These are the only movies Ive seen this year I also watched furious 7 but after I watch Tomorrowland and fury road I dont expect it to be on the list
2015-05-18 22:38:31,1,0,1,Furious 7,Furious 7 was cheesy and overdramatic but it was still fun to watch and the ending was beautiful tribute to Paul Walker Much like your life Furious 7 had mostly stupid bullshit and a few great moments to remember except the movie was more entertaining
2015-05-19 02:38:23,1,0,1,Furious 7,Luckily Furious 7 has a long intro credit scene But unfortunately its after a brief 1 minute opening scene with Jason statham So worst case scenario youll miss it
2015-05-19 03:50:53,1,0,1,Furious 7,You can probably do it  you honestly could watch the first 5 minutes of Furious 7 online if youre really worried
2015-05-20 15:05:20,1,0,1,Furious 7,Furious 7
2015-05-20 18:04:53,0,0,0,Furious 7,Shit Avengers has been great too And Furious 7 Honestly people complain about action movies but its really a great time to be a fan
2015-05-20 19:36:47,1,0,1,Furious 7,After seeing Kingsman Furious 7 Avengers and now Mad Max my recommended daily intake of action movies is satisfied for at least the next year
2015-05-20 19:53:53,1,0,1,Furious 7,Havent seen Avengers yet but Furious 7 was not a good movie in any way
2015-05-20 20:01:48,5,0,5,Furious 7,Now youre changing the topic PP2 will do just fine certainly But does Pitch Perfect belong in one of the most iconic cult franchises of the 1980s Mad Max has done better than any reboot or remake in quite some time and is likely to be in the top5 ever for Rrated action movies That is extremely good And if China acts anything like it did for the other actioncar movie Furious 7 it could easily outdo PP2 when its all said and done
2015-05-21 02:19:33,1,0,1,Furious 7,I really liked her cameo as the bodyguard in Furious 7
2015-05-21 03:49:16,1,0,1,Furious 7,Mad Max amp Furious 7 Hobbs lays out a bunch of whoopass on wasteland dwellers while Max shows Dom Torreto the meaning of a true super charged monster
2015-05-21 04:33:32,2,0,2,Furious 7,Fast and  Furious 6 and Furious 7 crossover  Well I guess  there  would  be fast cars  bald muscular  men and corona
2015-05-21 13:21:07,1,0,1,Furious 7,Everyone loves the rock the best part of furious 7 was the rock
2015-05-21 13:55:40,1,0,1,Furious 7,Hes the bad guy in Furious 7 but hes not in it that much and hes a relatively small part of why that film kicks ass
2015-05-21 13:56:16,1,0,1,Furious 7,He was an awesome villain in Furious 7
2015-05-21 14:38:22,2,0,2,Furious 7,I hated Fast and Furious 7 except every time Jason Statham was on screen  I swear it even switched directors and screen writers for his scenes  It was like some on screen messiah turning the quality knob up when he appeared
2015-05-21 15:34:04,3,0,3,Furious 7,Hey now I love Mad Max too but I wouldnt lump Furious 7 in with transformers The FF movies are a lot of tongue in cheek cheesy fun
2015-05-22 00:25:00,1,0,1,Furious 7,Only recently have started recently seeing movies more than once in theaters If they are that great i will see them more than once  Skyfall   interstellar  furious 7  star trek into darkness Godzilla
2015-05-22 04:59:37,1,0,1,Furious 7,Child 44 might fit that bill but not many have seen it and I cant find it in theaters anymore I havent seen it either but I read the book Kingsman is still in theaters but doesnt quite fit well with the other movies you listed Maybe Furious 7 but that also doesnt quite fit But if its not these then I probably dont know about it
2015-05-22 11:38:32,19,0,19,Furious 7,I dont know I thought the action scenes in Furious 7 were very hard to follow I do agree with your general point though
2015-05-23 03:19:30,1,0,1,Furious 7,Furious 7 The film was honestly a wreck The action is meh and there is hardly any racingdriving which the first few movies focused on The sendoff to Paul Walker at the end was not sad at all  in fact it was uplifting Literally everyone I know praises this movie but you would have to pay me to watch it again
2015-05-23 03:54:33,3,0,3,Furious 7,I thought his sendoff in the end of Furious 7 was quite clear I dont think there will be any further explanation in the next one
2015-05-23 07:49:33,1,0,1,Furious 7,Furious 7 I am a car dude who is just slightly too old to idolize Paul Walker like everyone seems to do these days but that ending had me tearing up like crazy The whole movie I was expecting them to get it over with and kill him off but the ending wasnt what I expected
2015-05-23 08:18:31,3,0,3,Furious 7,He was in Furious 7
2015-05-23 13:11:41,2,0,2,Furious 7,In Furious 7 when Roman is trying to waste time for the team It literally made me cringe
2015-05-24 05:21:06,7,0,7,Furious 7,Refreshing is the perfect word to describe this movie Possibly one of the reasons for its less than stellar reviews is that most critics have sunken into the dark despair of culture norm where optimism is seen as naive Before this I watched Avengers Furious 7 and Mad Max All three movies had a volume level of 210 This softer more beautiful and wonderful change of pace was just as mentioned eariler refreshing
2015-05-24 07:10:10,-13,0,-13,Furious 7,UNCLE Kingsman Spy its starting to all look the same Sure its summer fun movies but this is just too much After watching Furious 7 Avengers 2 Kingsman Ive had my fill of these mindless action movies for the year
2015-05-24 11:17:38,1,0,1,Furious 7,fast and furious 7 full hd
2015-05-24 16:15:29,22,0,22,Furious 7,It was the 1 comedy for 3 weeks Look at the releases in April  you had Furious 7 at 1 for four weeks Only other major movie to come out was the Age of Adeline which wasnt a comedy The first weekend of May had Avengers and thats not a comedy either so it was like 4 at the box office but still the 1 comedy
2015-05-24 17:29:45,0,0,0,Furious 7,Fast and Furious 7  It was a brilliant film individually and worked great as part of the series Also a great tribute to Paul Walker
2015-05-24 20:13:35,2,0,2,Furious 7,He was a fantastic villain in Furious 7
2015-05-25 00:05:45,2,0,2,Furious 7,Youre absolutely right Compared to say The Avengers 2 or Furious 7 this movie was simple but nothing was wasted Its like Jiros sushi and the others are like a buffet Sure a buffet gives you everything you want to eat but simplicity and presentation are just as important if not more so
2015-05-25 07:00:43,2,0,2,Furious 7,Depends on the movie furious 7 I dont care about physics and science but in more serious science fiction type movies yes it is important
2015-05-25 13:41:49,1,0,1,Furious 7,fast and furious 7 HD
2015-05-25 21:25:11,5,0,5,Furious 7,The ending of Furious 7
2015-05-26 04:46:44,1,0,1,Furious 7,Im talking about the C130 business Its happened in Godzilla Furious 7 Kingsman Captain America 2 The Incredible Hulk
2015-05-27 00:59:04,-1,0,-1,Furious 7,Now apparently Fast and Furious 7 is now something like the 4th highest grossing movie ever I havent seen that Or any of the trailers and only half of one of the other ones Ill not see it willingly and Ill certainly not pay to see it at any time in the future
2015-05-27 03:17:02,6,0,6,Furious 7,Furious 7 blew projections away Same with Pitch Perfect 2 just to name a few
2015-05-27 13:34:42,2,0,2,Furious 7,You should have seen rmovies when Furious 7 was released
2015-05-27 13:38:37,4,0,4,Furious 7,Furious 7
2015-05-27 15:38:24,6,0,6,Furious 7,Considering where Furious 7 placed its in for a decent shot at 1
2015-05-27 18:28:46,0,0,0,Furious 7,Furious 7 is going to take Avengers third spot first
2015-05-27 20:34:10,8,0,8,Furious 7,Me too After the billion dollar success of Furious 7 Im hoping some studio will let Vin Diesel make a fourth one in the style of The Chronicles of Riddick
2015-05-27 22:47:25,4,0,4,Furious 7,I dont know The rest of the world is developing so quickly for movies Just look at China Avatar didnt make that much there I believe cause they didnt have that many theatres I mean come on we now live in a world where Furious 7 can get passed 1 billion Something unthinkable just a few years ago
2015-05-27 22:56:27,0,0,0,Furious 7,I think that it will have the top opening weekends It can only take the top 3 Im sure it will beat Furious 7 Harry Potter 8 and Ultron if it has remarkable word of mouth If they call it the next Phantom Menace I dont think it stands a chance of beating Camerons Avatar and Titanic Im no expert though
2015-05-28 03:36:18,-1,0,-1,Furious 7,Yes your right they did do better than what most thought they would but for reasons unknown well maybe not pitch perfect but can anyone explain Furious 7 success nope its just a freak series that some how got popular it was dead by the third film and wound up being huge on the forth and has grown ever since it was a gamble that paid off big time for them
2015-05-28 13:58:27,0,0,0,Furious 7,The reason why its still sad is that in the 90s many films came close to making 1 billion with one going far over that mark Titanic Here we are now with tickets being more than twice what they were 20 years ago and still 1 billion is a challenge to reach even with the expansion in foreign markets and the price of 3D tickets People claimed this film might have beaten Titanic original and even its current WW box office number but it might not even beat Furious 7 at this point it probably will though which to me is sad Here you have this massive super hero team up film and it might lose to and film about driving cars wow the box office is a crazy place This proves that anything can happen at the box office AoU isnt the only sad BO run out there Im just saying that films should be making more money but they just aint but why why do they not make more Most likely its cause of wages anyone who works a minimum wage jobs has to work about 2 hours just to buy 1 ticket where in the 90s you could probably just work 1 hour Maybe its competition with games mobile phones or even TV All I know is that 15 billion should be more common and more than 2 films should have passed 2 billion by now
2015-05-28 16:40:04,-1,0,-1,Furious 7,Going by box office grosses mine is also Avatar It just never looked appealing to me Also in the top ten that I havent seen include The Avengers The Dark Knight Star Wars Episode I and The Dark Knight Rises Within the worldwide top ten add in Furious 7 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2 Avengers Age of Ultron Iron Man 3 and Transformers Dark of the Moon
2015-05-28 18:26:26,3,0,3,Furious 7,Sometimes Im fooled into thinking the climax happened when I watch the crazy scene from the trailer at the movies but its followed by something crazier ie In furious 7 I didnt expect the second building jump
2015-05-29 05:28:16,92,0,92,Furious 7,Furious 7 has Lucas Black age like 10 years in 5 seconds  It was so noticeable
2015-05-29 11:11:52,14,0,14,Furious 7,Nothing about Furious 7 makes sense so why bother D
2015-05-29 12:56:19,-4,0,-4,Furious 7,It was entertaining but it was hardly the best Furious 7 and San Andreas were at least equally enjoyable And honestly this is the discussion thread for San Andreas The discussion for Mad Max was 3 weeks ago If you want to keep talking about it you can try the bazillion other threads that have been started the last month here or simply go to rmadmax
2015-05-29 15:18:38,0,0,0,Furious 7,Yeah I keep seeing this point when it comes to Furious 7 but honestly how many people will go to see a movie just because it has someone from their ethnicity in it  Cool cars fun action sequences the April release not too many blockbusters came out at that time and the death of Paul Walker were the main drawing factors for this film IMO
2015-05-29 16:31:55,2,0,2,Furious 7,Speak for yourself I think Fast and Furious 7 is better than American Sniper
2015-05-29 16:57:52,2,0,2,Furious 7,Statham Spoilerss Furious 7 and Turn it Up
2015-05-29 17:25:26,14,0,14,Furious 7,I agree that simply having an original idea is not the bar But it helps The problem I see in cinema is the blatant cash grab that Hollywood does that cheapens a sequel For example I would say T2 was made because Cameron had better tech and really wanted to give the audience something special while also making a ton of money While T3 was a blatant cash grab  Another example would be Fast 1 and Fast 2 Started off being a fun cool movie Turned into blatant cash grab I wouldnt mind watching Furious 7 so much if I didnt feel like there was a company behind it making it FOR THE SOLE PURPOSE of money The cinema is inconsequential to the company If they could make that money filming rocks they would do it
2015-05-29 19:07:27,1,0,1,Furious 7,Finally someone speaking some sense Theyre fun mediocre movies at best I think Paul Wakers death had A LOT to do with its great box office The only kinda good one was Fast Five but man Furious 7 was straight up bad
2015-05-29 21:19:40,1,0,1,Furious 7,If you havent seen Furious 7 though you should I wasnt on board with the franchise early on in a loving sense I watched them and Id say Tokyo Drift was the cash grab as they had nearly no connection to the other two no common characters except a tiny cameo whereas PW was in 1 and 2 and so was an FBI guy I got on board fanhoodwise with Five I think I liked 4 that it brought people back and Five to me is where they hit their stride Anyway I get that people make money from it but genuinely Furious 7 was a great fun exciting movie
2015-05-30 01:42:37,1,0,1,Furious 7,Well reviews certainly tricked me on Fast and Furious 7 It gets 1 for Paul Walker nostalgia but aside from that its only slightly less cheesey than the rest
2015-05-30 01:59:34,-2,0,-2,Furious 7,People Honest talk Mad Max was a great film possibly the best action movie of this year so far But it wasnt cheap As of May 27 the film has grossed 100091391 short of breaking even with its estimated budget of 150000000 about how much Fast and Furious 7 made in just its opening weekend and Fifty Shades of Grey made gross Mad Max was a ballsy endeavor to say the least with a high budget for a series that hasnt been in the theater in nearly 30 years and a R rating to go along with it Ill let the numbers speak for themselves but as much as I think this film was great and want to see more if people dont talk about it more and get others to go out and see it the studios thinking about producing films like this will think they are MEDIOCRE
2015-05-30 02:49:15,1,0,1,Furious 7,See You Again  Furious 7
2015-05-30 05:10:06,1,0,1,Furious 7,Definitely this newoverplayed Wiz Khalifa song and Furious 7
2015-05-30 08:38:08,0,0,0,Furious 7,For what its worth I hated it From the beginning to the end I found it stupid Even less of a story than Furious 7 if thats even possible There was nothing interesting about it and I didnt care about any of the characters
2015-05-30 10:28:57,2,0,2,Furious 7,I never expected Furious 7 to break 15 billion Pleasantly surprised Watched it again tonight Even better second time around
2015-05-30 12:00:05,5,0,5,Furious 7,A lot of errors in that furious 7 script
2015-05-30 13:25:57,1,0,1,Furious 7,Furious 7 spoiler
2015-05-30 13:29:18,2,0,2,Furious 7,Proving once again that critics are complete morons and not worth paying attention too  The plot was so thin that I could describe it in a 1 page book report double spaced Sure it looked pretty and had some good action but so what  Furious 7 had better action Oh wait furious 7 is the 7th movie in a franchise of  this decade and mad max is a return to a very old franchise therefore obviously superior right
2015-05-30 17:57:10,1,0,1,Furious 7,Its so funny the hilariously bad script in end of watch and furious 7 took all the emotion out of those movies
2015-05-30 18:11:34,1,0,1,Furious 7,Im waiting to watch Mad Max Fury Road Avengers Age of Ultron and Furious 7 in theatres in succession right after my exams
2015-05-30 18:51:24,10,0,10,Furious 7,Yeah and this year he has this movie and Fast and Furious 7 which I heard did pretty ok at the box office
2015-05-30 21:44:49,10,0,10,Furious 7,The biggest movie in the world this year is Furious 7 The biggest tv show is Empire Tyler Perry is worth like a billion dollars
2015-05-30 23:19:53,0,0,0,Furious 7,Just because there are more movies being released with white leads doesnt make people think whiteness is the norm and everything else is other or strange No one puts so much importance on movies Like you said furious 7 has 1 white main cast member and it did amazing America is fine with diverse casts
2015-05-31 06:52:32,2,0,2,Furious 7,furious 7
2015-05-31 11:53:23,2,0,2,Furious 7,Are the same people seeing this and hating it watching Fast and Furious 7 and loving it  They are both shitty movies you just have to wipe a little bit more with this one
2015-05-31 18:01:07,1,0,1,Furious 7,The scene where the Rock destroys a military drone with an ambulance in Furious 7
2015-05-31 18:02:13,1,0,1,Furious 7,I swear this exact trailer ran in front of my screening of Furious 7 Theres no way this is new
2015-05-31 21:14:51,17,0,17,Furious 7,So the answers to Whats a movie similar to Pulp FictionThe Wolf of Wall StreetFast and Furious 7 Are all the same
2015-05-31 21:32:12,1,0,1,Furious 7,This week I got to see Furious 7 and San Andreas I know were supposed to be mentioning the best film we saw this week but I thought Id bring up San Andreas because even though it isnt great it was a fun movie to watch in theatres and wasnt all that bad despite lacking anything special in the storytelling department
2015-05-31 23:29:42,-1,0,-1,Furious 7,So does this mean that well see even less screentime from him in Fast 8 Cause damn he was hardly in Furious 7 and probably only shared the screen with Vin Statham and thats it
2015-05-11 00:35:14,1,0,1,White God,The best film I saw this week was the 2014 Festival de Cannes Prize un Certain Regard winner White God   For those  who havent seen or heard about it think of it as a cross between Lassie Come Home White Fang and Thirteen set in a contemporary Budapest that evokes the LA of Blade Runner directed by Quentin Tarantinos  long lost Hungarian twin  The plot is a bit like Disneys The Aristocats but with 300 or so real live dogs  This aint no fuckin Disney toon  Its one of the most disturbing films I have ever seen  Some have written it off as a failed film that was at its best when it tried to be a B grade horror film  The NY Times gave it strongly positive review that entirely missed what my collegeage daughter and I saw when we watched it  This is a multilayered film that could be read simply as a horrific dog story paralleled with a young girls coming of age story  On a second and predictably uninteresting level its an animal rights story  What my daughter and I but few if any reviewers saw was a 21st century allegory of modern Europe  In the movie the government taxes mongrels and lets people own purebred Hungarian dogs the AKC recognizes Vizlas Komondok and Pulik as Hungarian breeds tax free pretty much the opposite of the way dog rescue really works  She and I believe the stray dogs in the movie represent the African and Asian immigrants who appear in Hungary and other European nations looking for a new home  My daughter suggests that showing the atrocities humans commit on animals is the filmmakers way of making their political point to an audience that is desensitized to the atrocities humans perpetrate against other humans

2015-05-02 11:03:53,2,0,2,American Sniper,Arguments with people over why American Sniper got snubbed by not winning Beat Picture  They thought it was a travesty that it didnt win  They had seen none of the other nominees but American Sniper shouldve won because Merica  Great  Now Im angry again
2015-05-02 18:04:26,20,0,20,American Sniper,Fake baby scene in American Sniper
2015-05-03 05:25:08,1,0,1,American Sniper,The Sarlaac pit from Return of the Jedi and most of the desert scenes from Stargate were filmed in my backyard so to speak So were parts of Three Kings Jarhead American Sniper and a future Jonah Hill war movie So basically a sand dune wasteland in the desert south west
2015-05-04 15:49:50,5,0,5,American Sniper,American Sniper before you say anything just read i read the book before i saw the movie which i generally try not to do but in this case i did and the book is does an amazing job of showing what he went through i finished the book just amazed at what this guy and his family went through i then saw the movie and half the stuff in the movie never happened to him like him shooting the other sniperthat did happen but he wasnt the one to shoot him he wasnt even int he same area Also they even got the age he joined the seals wrong now i know that Hollywood takes certain liberties with True stories such as a beautiful mind and what really happened in John Nashs life in that case i read the book after the movie so it didnt bug me a beautiful mind is one of my favorite movies but in american snipers case i just couldnt help of think what happened in the book when i was watching the movie and how its so much more amazing however saying this Bradley Cooper and the cast involved did an amazing job it is by no means a bad movie
2015-05-04 21:14:13,1,0,1,American Sniper,Passion of the Christ and American Sniper both great films but so emotionally brutal Ill never see them again
2015-05-05 02:50:33,1,0,1,American Sniper,Honestly the American Sniper trailer was amazing It showed tension and depth in a short period of time far better than the movie overall did
2015-05-05 05:43:07,4,0,4,American Sniper,I cant believe the trailer for American Sniperhttpswwwyoutubecomwatchv99k3u9ay1gs hasnt been mentioned yet
2015-05-05 08:26:00,1,0,1,American Sniper,Star Wars getting competition from movies going for the Oscars Are you kidding me Do you have any idea what kind of money Oscar nominees make these days Let me break it to you Movies like American Sniper are the exception Most Oscar nominees barely break 100 million by the time their run finishes Start Wars has virtually no competition this Christmas because all the other potential blockbusters vacated the slots around it Warcraft got pushed to Summer 2016 King Fu Panda got pushed as well and Mission Impossible 5 got bumped up to this Summer Those movies were Star Wars competition and they all vacated the Christmas slot What does that tell you
2015-05-05 18:28:51,1,0,1,American Sniper,Surprised its not here with someone who actually hates it I dont hate it but American Sniper wasnt oscar nom worthy It was a super average film that got a ton of attention because of politics and CE
2015-05-06 00:17:59,2,0,2,American Sniper,The first three movies that were just released to buy digital American Sniper Fifty Shades of Grey and Jupiter Ascending are all missing from the Direct to Home list This website does not seem to be very good
2015-05-07 01:21:12,1,0,1,American Sniper,for sure thats one of his best movies but I only remember him from two movies that and Silver Linings Playbook Which he was really just in Jennifer stole the movie I havent seen American Sniper which doesnt count obviously but I have never seen him in anything else
2015-05-07 17:50:02,-7,0,-7,American Sniper,Thank you for not saying American Sniper I hated that movie Fury came out a few months before it and recieved less attention even though it was much better
2015-05-08 15:18:14,38,0,38,American Sniper,Yeah the opening scene in American Sniper felt like it was done in a knockoff version of a Adobe Aftereffects
2015-05-08 17:00:19,6,0,6,American Sniper,All the criticism of the CGI Blood and decidedly plastic baby has completely put me off watching American Sniper
2015-05-09 09:31:29,11,0,11,American Sniper,american sniper I thought it was going to be great but it ended up with me hating it

2015-05-10 18:30:05,1,0,1,American Sniper,Lone Survivor American Sniper Act of Valor Black Hawk Downhmm im starting to notice a pattern
2015-05-11 00:56:07,5,0,5,American Sniper,I loved it because you felt like a fly on the wall watching each scene like it was actually unfolding right then and there It also didnt take any cheap tricks to try and dramatize the events like how American Sniper just made up 90 of the movie into cliche Hollywood action Foxcatcher is an antiHollywood movie
2015-05-11 09:59:58,4,0,4,American Sniper,Bradley Cooper Thought he was only some good looking guys on Hangover but I was sold after Silver Lining Playboook Havent seen American Sniper yet but heard he also killed it
2015-05-11 17:49:08,24,0,24,American Sniper,American Sniper I saw it back in January before it exploded into popularity
2015-05-11 18:17:55,0,0,0,American Sniper,Look at how much money American Sniper and Fifty Shades of Grey made Rrated movies make a lot of money
2015-05-11 18:25:53,0,0,0,American Sniper,Compare it to PG13 films like Avengers Furious 7 Guardians of the Galaxy Those movies make so much more Both films had successful books to bring crowds in Plus American Sniper had Alist talent with Eastwood and Cooper I say this because someone will say the PG13 films had massive followings Sure they did but Sniper and Grey had followings as well for the reasons listed
2015-05-11 18:30:54,7,0,7,American Sniper,American Sniper made more domestically than any other movie in 2014 including Guardians of the Galaxy
2015-05-11 18:46:50,1,0,1,American Sniper,I walked out of American Sniper that shit was so boring
2015-05-11 20:18:45,9,0,9,American Sniper,Rrated films represent billions and billions at the box office Gladiator Django Unchained Hangover I amp II The Matrix I amp II Terminator 1 amp 2 amp 3 Passion of Christ 300 Saving Private Ryan Ted American Sniper 22 Jump Street 50 Shades of Gray Bridesmaids Gone Girl Jerry McGuire Wedding Crashers etc
2015-05-11 20:23:33,3,0,3,American Sniper,I expect it to do a 45M weekend but have strong holdover due to wordofmouth Rrated films have had a solid year American Sniper 50 Shades Kingsman Mad Max could build off that buzz
2015-05-11 20:56:11,5,0,5,American Sniper,I think it more has to do with content PG13 films make more money because they are made for more diverse audiences A film like Avengers will make more than mad max not because of the rating but because it appeals to all 4 quandrants children teens men and women where Mad Max wont play well to kids and maybe women The problem is that if they were to make Mad Max PG13 that is NOT going to win over the other 2 quadrants My big problem is when Hollywood believes this will work and decides to neuter what could be potentially awesome R rated movies Would Live Free or Die Hard have made less money if it was R The real issue is that sometimes it works for hollywood where they muted an R rated World War Z and turned it into a summer blockbuster The R rated cut is infinitely better and I urge you all to check it out I believe it is on Netflix I really hope that with American Sniper Kingsmen and now Mad Max that we see a return to R rated films I think that with mature shows like Game of Thrones and Walking dead being so popular that the public is craving some more edgy material especially on the big screen But like OP said if you want to see more films like this if you want to see less muted content vote with your dollar I know Im seeing this maybe even twice
2015-05-12 00:03:20,2,0,2,American Sniper,I know right Its not even like I dont like war movies I love the shit out of them But American Sniper was boring the shit out of me Saving Private Ryan Platoon Enemy at the Gates Black Hawk Down Behind Enemy Lines Full Metal Jacket and Apocalypse Now are good war movies American Sniper wasnt I mean even Jarhead was better than that turd movie No offense to anybody who liked it thats just my opinion
2015-05-12 10:37:46,9,0,9,American Sniper,Thats such a bs rule Why is it that American Sniper can premier in November and still get nommed but Blue is the warmest colour cant
2015-05-12 11:04:29,19,0,19,American Sniper,American Sniper isnt affected by it since its not a foreign picture But I agree its a stupid rule

2015-05-13 01:27:15,1,0,1,American Sniper,Both are good but Project Almanac was just more fun to watch Seeing a group of high schoolers mess around with time traveling appeals more to me But Im not a total pleb I assure you The Theory of Everything is now tied to American Sniper for my favorite film of 2015
2015-05-13 04:36:09,1,0,1,American Sniper,The end of American Sniper I remember watching the procession and Kyle is from my hometown so it all hits me right there in the feels

2015-05-14 11:10:16,-15,0,-15,American Sniper,I fear we will not be able to have unbiased discussion on this movie It has become clouded by the word Feminism I fear this film will be like the discussions following American Sniper This film will become a political Rorschach Test which will have people prejudging the film based on their own political views

2015-05-14 13:47:38,7,0,7,American Sniper,Its a real shame Normally I dont agree with the reddit practical effects are always better circlejerk  but animated blood can really take me out of a movie American Sniper is a great example  the movie felt so authentic and real until he shot someone The color and lighting on CGI blood is never quite right and the fluid dynamics are never as good as the real thing It ended up just looking like something from a bad zombie bmovie
2015-05-14 15:00:07,2,0,2,American Sniper,Most are mainly because they portray Americans as the eventual heroes fighting some tyrannical force Look at  American Sniper Some saw it as a movie about a war hero gunned down before his time after performing numerous honorable actions overseas On the other end some people saw it as ninety minutes worth of bragging based on dubious morality and a trigger happy soldier But no matter what his character in the movie was portrayed as above board and justified in his actions American movies show what war is like for us They dont show what happened to native civilians when we invaded Iraq or Afghanistan It doesnt show what happens when we pull out of a nation Even movies that show war in a more brutal light focus on the hardships of our soldiers and how their our cause is just

2015-05-16 20:17:40,17,0,17,American Sniper,I skipped American Sniper because my friends wanted to watch that Kevin Hart movie
2015-05-16 20:18:44,2,0,2,American Sniper,What needs to be reinvigorated Rrated movies do extremely well American Sniper was the highest domestic earning movie of last year Fifty Shades of Grey has made hundreds of millions of dollars this year already Rrated movies do and have always made money Hell Mad Max isnt even rated R in Canada and that is counted in the domestic gross figures
2015-05-16 20:38:30,-2,0,-2,American Sniper,Ratings have nothing to do with it Movies have long legs when theyre good and there is no competition For Mad Max to have enough legs to make it profitable it needs a lot less competition As it stands it has a pretty small window to make money Its not like American Sniper where its the only movie people want to watch in theaters for a month There are a lot of box office stars with films coming out very soon and that is going to hurt this movie a lot

2015-05-17 12:46:36,-3,0,-3,American Sniper,I dont think youre missing anything Its just not a good movie but it was well liked by Americans because of patriotism Same for goes for American Sniper
2015-05-17 14:22:11,2,0,2,American Sniper,I heard a lot of praise for American Sniper in the UK including reviews which viewed it as a strongly antiwar It definitely wasnt just down to patriotism its fine not to like it but its reductive to attribute the praise exclusively to patriotism when that clearly wasnt the case
2015-05-17 15:25:34,0,0,0,American Sniper,Beasts of the Southern Wild I usually try to watch all the movies that are nominated for best picture and so far Ive more or less liked all of them Even American Sniper I thought was pretty okay and that was the weakest besides Beasts I remember trying to watch beasts and I was beyond bored I had no sympathy for the father character so it made no sense to me that the girl was upset when he was lost or killed or whatever sorry it has been a while so I may be getting some of this wrong The movie wasnt even that long for an oscar nomine I think it was 145 and for the life of me I couldnt get through it turned it off an hour in What a friggin snooze fest
2015-05-17 16:09:50,254,0,254,American Sniper,American Sniper Completely divorced from the bigger discussions about the films take on veterans and American at war and about the authors purported fabrication of elements of the story I just thought the film wasnt particularly good Bradley Coopers performance was fine but the script was super rushedthey tried to fit in background three tours of duty and three stops back home between those tours into one film which made the whole thing feel rushed I felt like there wasnt enough time to invest in Coopers character so it was hard to chart the changes that his character was supposed to be going through and in turn hard to sympathize with him The tone of the story waffled toois this a gritty realistic account of war or a shootemup with bad guys The movie ended incredibly abruptly too which is not to mention the absurdity in the final scene no spoilers of a war veteran teasing his wife by pointing a real gun at her That all mixed in with other ridiculous quirks of the film including the plastic baby debacle among other things made me pretty baffled to hear that it was the highestgrossing war film of all time
2015-05-17 19:09:04,2,0,2,American Sniper,Yeah hes been very pandering lately Gran Torino was particularly bad for a movie that is so loved I guess he basically figured out people like to see him grumble like a bitter old man and say borderline racist lines because hes form a different era It also doesnt help that the actor that plays the main kid is just awful as a matter of fact everyone in that movie is an awful actor except the girl and of course Eastwood Flags of Our Fathers played out in a very similar way American Sniper did a movie that pretends to be about something deeper than just American circlejerk but falls flat I guess he needed to milk the obligatory theme of remembering that one time the US went to war and the whole world actually cheered them on
2015-05-17 19:58:01,2,0,2,American Sniper,For all intensive purposes American Sniper did achieve what I wanted to see in this movie and it is a stirling character piece The problem is Clint Eastwoods film making cuts corners so people focus on that and not the story of a man who went to combat claimed to kill 300 people and then came home to the ire of the American people who discovered what a horrible sham the Iraq war was
2015-05-17 20:41:55,1,0,1,American Sniper,Yep Went to go see American Sniper and they showed the trailer for Fury Road They had no idea what a Mad Max was Shame I know
2015-05-17 22:29:06,1,0,1,American Sniper,Also totally unrelated but how is it that in the final cut of American Sniper a fake baby was used during a very dramatic and serious moment in the film

2015-05-18 21:40:01,1,0,1,American Sniper,Probably not the best but I thought the first real trailer for American Sniper was quite well done The one that revolves around him determining if the child is a threat Established the tone and plot of the movie effectively without giving away any major plot points
2015-05-19 00:06:42,11,0,11,American Sniper,American Sniper is just not a very good movie overall When the wife was listening to her husband at war and collapsed outside of the doctors office is probably the most razzie award winning moment in the film

2015-05-19 07:59:07,10,0,10,American Sniper,I work at a DVD store I literally get to see every movie that was released last year come through that door and I can definitely tell you what youre saying is demonstrably not true in terms of whats coming out now Half of the movies released are dramas drom coms or horror films The amount of childish action is not really in huge supply Seriously 4 superhero films came out last year not including TMNT People have always wanted to see big budget blockbusters in theaters But what was the highest grossing film last year It wasnt one of the three super hero movies it was American Sniper A drama It made more money and had more interest than any of the big 15 year old loving films of the decade That was just last year And it was accompanied by a million dramas like Cake Selma Still Alice Fury a freakin war film Into the Woods a musical Imitation Game various R rated comedies adult comedies dont come out Neighbors 22 Jump Street This is where I leave you were not for kids and many more art think pieces Birdman Theory of Everything So I just cant see how your argument is valid Sure we are getting more superhero films but that doesnt mean were getting less variety If anything hollywood is taking even more chances on films with original ideas or risky ideas and variety than ever Tomorrowland Mad Max Inside Out Pitch Perfect to name some other tentpoles this summer This concocted notion that Comic book movies dominate film is just not true The few that come out a year make excellent cash and are increasingly pushing both the boundaries of their genre and of film in general SOOOOO many films come out of hollywood besides superhero flicks so I just dont get why youre upset about that Whats wrong with getting the same excitement out of a film that appeals to 15 year old you Isnt that what movies are supposed to do Make you get that awe and inspiration that you did when you were a kid
2015-05-19 14:02:47,-1,0,-1,American Sniper,Again they co produce and co finance With Warner Bros They dont have the financial resources to fund movies like The Matrix American Sniper and Edge of Tomorrow on their own nor does any Australian production company
2015-05-19 20:46:20,4,0,4,American Sniper,gt American Sniper is just not a very good movie overall
2015-05-19 22:37:54,3,0,3,American Sniper,See I disagree I felt that movie you could really see the directors dare I say passion The movie may be insane biblically inaccurate etc but it was a very interesting movie American Sniper is very afraid to be anything but tepid
2015-05-20 00:22:33,-1,0,-1,American Sniper,I agree with you from the second paragraph down But again lots of people really liked the Trasformers movies Lots of people really thought Crash deserved to win best picture Youre trying to make an objective point about something subjective You said American Sniper wasnt anything special Lots of people will disagree And that doesnt make them wrong
2015-05-20 00:40:41,2,0,2,American Sniper,Obviously American Sniper is going to sell best at least here in the US I personally didnt enjoy the film it felt like it couldnt decide whether it wanted to be prowar or antiwar nor could it blend both sides very well The films end also might be one of the worst and most abrupt Ive ever seen
2015-05-21 02:26:14,1,0,1,American Sniper,Yup  Just saw Mad Max Fury Road then went and bought American Sniper on blu ray

2015-05-27 14:03:44,2,0,2,American Sniper,Any part in Aliens when theyre walking around with their beepy things More recently though the scene from American Sniper with the boy and the guy with the drill
2015-05-28 06:41:07,1,0,1,American Sniper,Saving Private Ryan the lion king Bambi we were soldiers black hawk down American sniper Turner and hooch so pretty much any movie where an American soldier or dog dies
2015-05-28 14:10:38,6,0,6,American Sniper,American Sniper is not blatant propaganda It showed a man who nearly tears his family apart with his constant deployments who comes home haunted after seeing atrocities and losing friends He nearly kills the family dog in front of everyone at a bbq and they went no holds barred on showing veterans who came home missing body parts I was in the Marines when we went to Fallujah and at no point did I take that movie as a prowar film
2015-05-28 16:35:51,0,0,0,American Sniper,American Sniper Turned out to be a patriotic unrealistic hollywood circlejerk
2015-05-28 22:53:16,5,0,5,American Sniper,Nah youre in the right Well I mean to each their own of course But I agree American Sniper was overhypedpraised Potent combination of Eastwooddirectorial work and bleedingontheflagtomakesurethestripesstayred patriotic lunacy Beyond all that it suffered from stuttering disjointed fartoofast pacing Never got to stick around in a scene long enough to development an attachment to what went on
2015-05-28 22:58:10,4,0,4,American Sniper,Probably not the most ridiculous but there were groups of people that got swept up in the Patriotism of American Sniper and guaranteed it was going to clean up at the Oscars Most of the people I spoke to that had this belief hadnt even bothered to see the other films nominated
2015-05-28 23:05:58,-13,0,-13,American Sniper,Gone girl was one of the dumbest movies Ive ever seen American Sniper was at least the best action film of the year or one of them Gone girl was the worst of everything except for the scene where she spoiler cuts buddys throat while theyre fucking That was pretty cool Ben Affleck is such a terrible actor
2015-05-28 23:30:04,17,0,17,American Sniper,I havent seen American Sniper yet but damn Act of Valor was horrible
2015-05-28 23:50:28,11,0,11,American Sniper,No shit  I only started seeing commercials for it like a week ago and it looks like either the worlds worst sequel to American sniper or just another movie where broadly cooper makes out with a girl 1520 years younger than him
2015-05-29 00:32:22,9,0,9,American Sniper,I mean it was based off of his autobiography which was coincidentally titled American Sniper Still no idea where their logic was when they titled the film American Sniper Doesnt make sense
2015-05-29 00:35:00,3,0,3,American Sniper,Well the Huffington Post reported The AmericanArab AntiDiscrimination Committee said this week that threats against Muslims and Arabs have soared following the release of American Sniper a hugely popular and hugely controversial film
2015-05-29 00:58:16,3,0,3,American Sniper,I think people are mistaking an Oscar nomination for acclaim So many films are nominated for Best Picture now so that title doesnt hold hardly the weight it used to And even then it never meant a lot to even win and American Sniper wasnt even close to winning Im sure
2015-05-29 01:05:21,2,0,2,American Sniper,Id watch it if it ended with american sniper hugging the baby so hard his head popped off
2015-05-29 02:06:45,-3,0,-3,American Sniper,So every thread Ive seen about American Sniper on Reddit is full of fuckasses then right Its ok if it fits your narrative am I right Im gonna go through the comments If I dont see the comment you made to me beside every comment calling this movie American propaganda then Im coming back to this comment and calling you a fuckass
2015-05-29 02:23:29,-1,0,-1,American Sniper,government propaganda is apolitical that is american sniper isnt republican or democratic propaganda its US armed forces propaganda which frankly doesnt give a shit what the letter before your name is
2015-05-29 02:27:53,6,0,6,American Sniper,its weird because it seemed that lone survivor elicited more feelings of hoorah patriotism than American sniper but there wasnt as much controversy with that
2015-05-29 02:38:55,-1,0,-1,American Sniper,Dude youre out of your mind or in denial if you dont think the opinion American Sniper is propaganda doesnt split down the party line obviously not 100 so but as always on reddit need to state the obvious
2015-05-29 02:53:53,2,0,2,American Sniper,I see your point but I just fail to see American Sniper as propaganda in the first place and pretty much agree with Shnikies that most people who bitch and complain with this movie would consider themselves liberaldemocrats while most who enjoyed it and dont ordain it propaganda are conservativerepublicans
2015-05-29 03:31:42,7,0,7,American Sniper,Yes exactly My favorite canned antiAmerican Sniper hate comment is always He called them SAVAGES

2015-05-29 20:14:59,1,0,1,American Sniper,American Sniper was an average film to me It failed to do anything spectacular The most memorable part was the fake baby scene bad scenes can be memorable too  The popular reaction however has been infuriating Its a perfect example of group think People react to the subject matter instead of the film itself which was quite shallow and predictable The story of Chris Kyle is fascinating but American Sniper managed to white wash it and dull it down into a boiler plate overly patriotic action flick The story could have been so much more
2015-05-29 22:24:28,1,0,1,American Sniper,Lone Survivor was nonstop unrealistic action the entire time There was no plot aside from all out violence The actors were cast terribly to add onto the films mediocrity I was so disappointed with that movie American Sniper delved way more into the human aspects of war and the mentalemotional difficulties these guys go through Lone Survivor was just shooting and explosions IMO
2015-05-30 16:32:09,1,0,1,American Sniper,dont think its a hard one at all district 9 is so far ahead of American Sniper
2015-05-30 16:54:17,1,0,1,American Sniper,havent seen american sniper so im commenting between rejects and birdman  i really liked birdman and its style plus the story was great  rejects is for a niche viewer  its awesome if you love classic gritty dark horror  im a horror fan so im taking rejects 1 but birdman is just as worthy  i do know not everyone likes rejects so birdman may be the safer play
2015-05-30 17:07:11,2,0,2,American Sniper,District 9 I dont know about the other 2 I hardly liked anything les mis and American Sniper is cool once if you are going to watch it with a lot of people

2015-05-31 21:08:29,16,0,16,American Sniper,Heres why I personally think Unforgiven works and American Sniper doesnt
2015-05-01 00:10:23,1,0,1,Home,Having viewed many of my old faves on the big screen I was too young to see them in the theater when they came out hes got a point It is a different perspective the films atmosphere plays out a bit differently and you notice things youd never seen before I managed to tense up during a showing of Alien even though Id seen it a hundred times at home
2015-05-01 00:41:00,1,0,1,Home,Yeah I dunno I guess I am in the minority but I feel ambivalent towards this movie I wasnt really convinced going in that Pynchons work would be filmable and thats still how I feel But I think PTA came as close as anyone could and you can tell how much he respects the author It had its moments and the cinematography was amazing but it also felt like they were trying to fit too much into too little Some dialogue seemed to only exist in order to cram in necessary plot points  All the best dialogue was straight from the novel Good performances though especially Brolin All in all I think PTA was really driven to do this and I admire that but it mostly just made me want to go home and read
2015-05-01 00:51:19,2,0,2,Home,If thats really from pictures and memory its pretty impressive I only looked through the first couple of pages but most of the iconic images are there although the art is nothing to write home about and of course I have no idea if the dialogues have any relation to the movie

2015-05-05 04:11:38,1,0,1,Home,Yeah they were manipulating them but they also did a lot of good for their town They provided a home and safety for them even if it meant lying to them and frightening them But they really did have good intentions Plus were not even sure that they won in the end because Ivy knows about the land past the forest and her dad is also starting to see that the whole village idea might be bad so I think if the story went on either of them would have just came forward with the truth

2015-05-05 15:36:23,1,0,1,Home,Its been a few years since Ive last watched this film but could the camera scanning just be a product of the film being transferred to a different aspect ratio for video I know that this is the case for other older films that were transferred from the theater to home video

2015-05-05 16:31:40,439,0,439,Home,No thanks the last thing the film needed was another character involved I think Age of Ultron showed why some films need to be given more freedom in the run time because honestly if it was 3 hours then the whole film would have benefited Especially if Marvel want to keep connecting stories and for example link with Thor his whole story side plot felt very forced and affected the pacing I know studios want to make as much money as possible so that is absolutely fair enough What isnt fair though is how the fans cant enjoy a much better film on home video The lack of director or extended cuts out there is shocking The Dark Knight Rises and Age of Ultron are 2 quite big superhero films that could have massively improved with extended cuts They need to be common practice for films telling big stories

2015-05-06 18:32:45,2,0,2,Home,Well Im approaching this from the perspective of a film fan with not a lot of familiarity with the comics especially Ultron I interpret the Avengers at this point as a system which is awaiting a genuine threat not something essentially homegrown Im very curious to see what Hank Pym has to say about them and superheroics in general in July because my sense from the Antman trailers is that hes got a chip on his shoulder about Fury and Howard Starks approach to things and maybe represents the skeptical side of this universe which further sets the table for Civil War and based on what I have read about Thanos the Mad Titan lusts after death so when Nick Fury told the World Security Council that the Avengers are ready to face threats on every world well there you go thats what Thanos is a real threat and much much worse than Loki Ultron was a proverbial hiccup on the road to Thanos

2015-05-07 14:26:39,9,0,9,Home,Maybe Im alone but my favorite SpiderMan I grew up with was the early 90s SpiderMan when Todd McFarlane and Erik Larsen drew and wrote the comic Peter Parker was an obsessive adult with muscles and sometimes had a motorcycle and a hot nagging red haired wife As a 10 yr old I thought that was cool I dont get the need for Parker to be tangible Its a guy that climbs walls I think reading about a worrying guy that downs himself is worse for boys than reading about a guy wanting to obsessively fix a problem like NYC crime and in the end bang his hot wife  Most of the issues SpiderMan would get out of bed with his wife fight crime and then go home back to bed That was awesome and then clone saga and then they retcon his marriage and All the attempts like ultimate SpiderMan has sucked and dont hold to Todd and Eriks run in my point of view

2015-05-07 16:46:34,17,0,17,Home,Im to the point where I fucking hate Spiderman and his movies  They never get the tone right and the liberties they take especially with villains costumes just make them absolutely awful  Spiderman isnt supposed to be this oh woe is me Im a dork in real life and I have zero selfconfidence character hes supposed to be a bit of a prick with a great sense of humor who never takes himself or anything too seriously  They need to cut the Aunt May time down like crazy for these new movies  I dont give a shit that his old Aunt May gets mad when he comes home late why the fuck do we have to see that same scenario ten times per movie  Let the kid do his fucking job  Nobody wants to see Peter Parker the kid who gets grounded for being Spiderman they want to see Peter Parker making villains look like total assholes tearing them to bits while he makes fun of them the entire time  Fuck getting a teenager to play him they wont understand the role  Get Norm Macdonald  Who cares if hes in his 50s now
2015-05-07 16:47:21,3,0,3,Home,Well we never saw it in Imax there isnt one near this one horse town and we enjoyed just fine at home for a couple of years after its release Only this last time was a disappointment A few things stood out

2015-05-07 17:03:04,5,0,5,Home,I guess her struggles in a new place are a conflict of sorts its definitely the issue that needs to be resolved in the film to feel at home
2015-05-07 17:16:45,20,0,20,Home,Amelie has tremendous conflict  Her relationship with her father the various personal relationships around her home and even inner conflict  That last one is key as the movie is very much about her attempting to resolve that inner conflict and the other ones Ive noted all play into that

2015-05-07 21:16:56,7,0,7,Home,Thats what I like about this one  In most coming of age movies the plot centers around high school kids growing up and having fun with each other but realizing that theyll be moving on soon  In the Way Way Back his life sucks from beginning to end but at least he gets a handle on things and is better prepared for his life back home
2015-05-07 21:34:48,57,0,57,Home,I remember being 14 in 1994 and my dad coming home giddy as a school kid Now my dad was a hard as nails type person and giddy isnt something that anyone would ever call him But that day he was He had just seen Pulp Fiction at the movies with some coworkers and he demanded that I get dressed right away and go with him to see it at our local theater This was at around 8pm on a school night That was the night I realized that my dad was a movie geek and so was I From that day forth we watched every movie together and always had a really good talk about it afterward

2015-05-07 23:55:27,1,0,1,Home,Its game over for film Consistency is hard to maintain in terms of raw stock development and printing Plus the number of theaters with traditional film projection is dwindling Digital was an inferior choice just a few years ago but since the theater chains have updated to digital projection I would argue that digital acquisition is now the standard Sure you can shoot film and scan to digital to finish but it will increasingly cost more and provide less actual benefit as newer digital technology advances Besides 4K TVs and projectors we will begin to see new HDR technology in use at home and in the theater A 4K HDR DCP from an Alexa 65 production will outshine 65mm IMAX film in terms of dynamic range resolution and perceived contrastsharpness
2015-05-08 00:00:36,2,0,2,Home,Theres definitely debates on home theater forums  Some clamor for true IMAX aspect ratios on IMAX scenes  Others with constant height setups dont even want the scenes in 169 keep the whole movie in 235

2015-05-08 05:31:51,3,0,3,Home,I heard that John Travolta and Tim Allens relationship became increasingly heated during the production of Wild Hogs Tim was under the impression he was filming for the straight to DVD continuation of the Santa Clause films titled The Santa Clause Herbie Fully Loaded Travolta caught wind of this and teased Tim throughout the production of the film allegedly repeating the phrase Youre an Old Dog over and over until Tim finally broke into hysterics and retreated to the corner of the studio singing the theme to Home Improvement while in the fetal position Thankfully director Walt Becker had enough stock footage of Allen riding his hog that he could successfully CGI Tim into the rest of his scenes without ruining the artistic integrity of the film
2015-05-08 05:57:07,1,0,1,Home,You make some excellent points however I cant help but not think of Rambos closing monologue in the first film to kind of bring the whole point home and Rambos final speech to the Colonel at the end of the second as well The series is very much an extension of war creating some action scenarios that really would never happen and just perpetuating a war that has ended but those few instances that give the films a deeper meaning elevates the entire experience Rambo is about a man unable to escape violence and war as much as it is about the action and violence itself
2015-05-08 07:09:41,7,0,7,Home,Rear Window  the movie is very clever It is about a reporter who is home with a fractured hand Because of lack of anything else to do he watches out of his rear view window into the apartment across And he sees something interesting or does he thats for you to find out

2015-05-09 10:27:54,1,0,1,Home,A good theory Ive heard for why Yoda asked Luke to be brought to his family on Tatooine is because he knew it would be too painful for Vader to ever return home
2015-05-09 10:29:10,2,0,2,Home,I actually watched the film recently after a friend who had seen it before said that the film told a very significant story in terms of masculinity Admittedly I didnt completely grasp what my friend truly meant so I was curious as to what everyone else thought But sure Ive got some homework Ill go do
2015-05-09 10:36:18,1,0,1,Home,In my day you loaded up thehun opened a dozen windows not tabs and you prayed for no viruses and that your parents didnt come home for another hour And you liked it At least enough to keep doing it
2015-05-09 13:10:16,2,0,2,Home,Yeah this year was the first year in a while I sat down and actually watched it undistracted Its crazy how well laid out it is leaving not a single question to the viewer  Then go watch Home Alone 2 right after  While still entertaining it doesnt hold up nearly as well
2015-05-09 13:39:38,1,0,1,Home,I remember this feeling when I was watching first two seasons of Homeland
2015-05-09 14:03:40,3,0,3,Home,The movie was shot in my home town so I was excited to see it  I didnt think there was much depth to it at all  Maybe because Ive been surrounded by those types of guys growing up  As an Italian American I thought the dinner table scenes were so stereotypical and that came simply from lazy writing and acting
2015-05-09 15:28:30,1,0,1,Home,Well I was just thinking for the most part in everyday life you dont experience these situations all that often  Wake up go to work come home game watch a movie sleep do it all againbut the more I think about it the more I can think of scenarios when they do occur fairly commonlyeven so I cant imagine doing something so dumb as to remove my own helmet on an alien planet  If I could help it I wouldnt do it for the entire duration I was there even if there was air to breathe simply due to the fact that foreign disease has been the downfall of many a civilization and that is what I thought when I was in the theatre watching
2015-05-09 15:41:12,1,0,1,Home,The sets in Home Alone are amazing The kids bedrooms were all idealistic version of what a kid would want a bedroom to be The basement was every bit as terrifying as I remember basements being as a kid And the attic while cool still had that dank I dont want to sleep up there look to it
2015-05-09 15:45:19,4,0,4,Home,No they were in the process of installing equipment  It was never stated that they were about to return home  However because they were just in the middle of the job they set out to do you could infer that they werent up there very long
2015-05-09 15:58:38,2,0,2,Home,Yea its like horror for people who watch a lot of horror movies You watch a couple and after a while you kinda get desensitized to all the crazy shit that happens in home invasion films and the like Funny Games basically grabs you and shows you look this is what you want to see right Look at how fucked up this is Go on enjoy yourself then Oh you cant Well too fucking bad were gonna show you the inevitable ending in all its horror
2015-05-09 16:28:22,1,0,1,Home,Funny People is pretty close  The main character played by Adam Sandler is a fictional famous comedian but he pals around with comedians playing themselves throughout the film like Norm McDonald Ray Ramano and Sarah Silverman  Theres also a scene where hes hanging out with Eminem  The movie also starts off with real home video footage of a young Adam Sandler making prank phone calls so even his character feels like its just supposed to be Adam Sandler
2015-05-09 17:03:29,3,0,3,Home,The Purge It was such a cool idea and they confined anarchy into one single home Granted I heard the second one was better because they expanded it but I was really disappointed in the first one
2015-05-09 17:29:26,8,0,8,Home,Ill address the dumbest thing you said The tornado scene was around people that knew him in his hometown The oil rig thing was people he didnt know that had no way of identifying him Why is it that people that criticize this movie seemed to have not actually seen it
2015-05-09 17:31:57,1,0,1,Home,Vampire Horror I just watched A Girl Walks Home Alone at Night it was really good Let the Right One In is the best in my opinion
2015-05-09 17:33:44,-2,0,-2,Home,No I fully disagree Skyfall is so bad Stupid story that begins with a list and then all of a sudden its simply crazy dude versus M in a Home Alone sequence I truly hate skyfall Plus it makes no sense within the continuity We move from Bond being new to him being this old agent ready to retire
2015-05-09 17:36:05,-6,0,-6,Home,They werent in his home town they were on a highway when the tornado hit He didnt even need to use his powers An athletic young adult like him could have easily gotten the dog even if he wasnt a superman
2015-05-09 18:03:35,1,0,1,Home,I think were agreeing here lol People may say 13 are optional but maybe only because theyre bad What would make 13 optional and 79 required Same characters continuation of existing stories revisiting established placesstories Chewy were home
2015-05-09 18:13:10,1,0,1,Home,Yeah the matrix one is still a plot hole  Even if Cypher lied about a date the Operator can still see where Cypher goes and can see him talking to an agent  It would also be very suspicious if Cypher went off the grid going off the grid like at the Meravingians home or the train station
2015-05-09 18:30:16,1,0,1,Home,I had such high hopes for the third one What made me really sad was the 5 seconds of Beorn we got and that stupid ending Ok Im just going home now Bye

2015-05-09 19:01:08,1,0,1,Home,I game over 60 FPS every day Ive been a PC gamer since the Mid 80s  Rendered graphics and filmed humans are the not the same visual experience  48 FPS and motion smoothing on TV sets which also creates high frame rates makes cinema look like home movie garbage
2015-05-09 19:53:03,1,0,1,Home,putting aside for the time that the only way for your statements to be internally consistent would be that the DVD came out a few weeks after the film I personally had seen it and had issues with it before I even got onto the internet to read what others thought stuff I was discussing with people on the way home
2015-05-09 20:18:50,1,0,1,Home,Well thats their opinion but I thought it looked really good and coupled with the 3D it looked like you were really there It looked like you were watching an action packed theater play Some might consider that a negative thing but I thought it was great It was something new and different I go to movies to have experiences not to do the same thing I could be doing at home Also during 24 fps action scenes 3D is often blurry but with 48 fps that problem didnt exist
2015-05-09 20:59:24,2,0,2,Home,610  I liked the action but a superhero movie has never troubled me as much as this one  At the end of the film I sat there thinking about the hundreds maybe thousands of people who had lost there lives homes andor way of life due to irresponsibility and narcissism  And you laugh shake hands slap each other on the backs and look toward the next adventure  Exactly who were the bad guys in this movie  I left thinking that one  I dont like Tony Stark and two IMO the Red Witch is far more dangerous than the Hulk  Im already pumped for Captain America Civil War and Batman vs Superman  If the film intended for me to feel this way then it was a great movie  It was very thought provoking
2015-05-09 21:12:44,4,0,4,Home,A group of everyday normal people who through environmental conditioning have developed into what are basically homicidal maniacs who have endured absolutely unfathomable hardships Have band together and are sent to accomplish these harrowing missions absolutely herculean tasks that promise no safe passage home Some would call them a suicide mission

2015-05-09 22:07:54,2,0,2,Home,Well The Sum of all Fears wasnt bad pretty entertaining IIRC it was delayed due to 911 Ironically the original story involved Arab terrorists but the movie changed it to neonazis I dont think this had anything to do with 911 Im guessing it still hit too close to home for some though
2015-05-09 23:42:51,-1,0,-1,Home,You folks need to quit with the reductio ad absurdum arguments for every other thing The situation you described is just not comparable Think harder Homer

2015-05-10 05:57:44,1,0,1,Home,Some may find Always a little sappy but I enjoyed it Richard Dreyfuss John Goodman and Holly Hunter The cinematography scenery and sound are great Love the interactions between Dreyfuss and Goodman Love all the scenes with the planes Will pick up the BluRay one of these days just to enjoy it on my home theater
2015-05-10 06:18:47,1,0,1,Home,I would have turned off the movie well before the sex scene if I was watching at home I really did not enjoy the experience of going to this movie
2015-05-10 09:38:40,1,0,1,Home,I think it would of been a more interesting movie if it was either lots of little set pieces on Arnies journey to find his daughter or the same little set pieces of Arnie taking his daughter home at least one last time
2015-05-10 11:12:46,1,0,1,Home,i mean can you blame them they exist to make money and blockbusters make money and as much as i hate it people like me are part of the problem I can really only afford to go out to the movies with everyone maybe once a month and i tend to save it for the things that are best experienced on a giant screen with awesome sound i definitely watch these kinds of movies couple a week sometimes but i wait and watch them at home for example i loved a most violent year and i dont regret for a minute watching it in the comfort of my home and saw interstellar instead if anything those kinds of movies are more enjoyable when im stretched out on the couch with my blanket and a beer for a fraction of what it costs for the wife and i to have a good night at the movies

2015-05-11 00:35:14,1,0,1,Home,The best film I saw this week was the 2014 Festival de Cannes Prize un Certain Regard winner White God   For those  who havent seen or heard about it think of it as a cross between Lassie Come Home White Fang and Thirteen set in a contemporary Budapest that evokes the LA of Blade Runner directed by Quentin Tarantinos  long lost Hungarian twin  The plot is a bit like Disneys The Aristocats but with 300 or so real live dogs  This aint no fuckin Disney toon  Its one of the most disturbing films I have ever seen  Some have written it off as a failed film that was at its best when it tried to be a B grade horror film  The NY Times gave it strongly positive review that entirely missed what my collegeage daughter and I saw when we watched it  This is a multilayered film that could be read simply as a horrific dog story paralleled with a young girls coming of age story  On a second and predictably uninteresting level its an animal rights story  What my daughter and I but few if any reviewers saw was a 21st century allegory of modern Europe  In the movie the government taxes mongrels and lets people own purebred Hungarian dogs the AKC recognizes Vizlas Komondok and Pulik as Hungarian breeds tax free pretty much the opposite of the way dog rescue really works  She and I believe the stray dogs in the movie represent the African and Asian immigrants who appear in Hungary and other European nations looking for a new home  My daughter suggests that showing the atrocities humans commit on animals is the filmmakers way of making their political point to an audience that is desensitized to the atrocities humans perpetrate against other humans
2015-05-11 00:50:38,2,0,2,Home,Its not about doing the homework as  the world of NGE isnt a 11 replica of some Western mythos   Its a cartoon  it borrows some pretty intense imagery and themes from the religious tradition and scrambles them into its own mix as necessary for the purpose of telling its own story

2015-05-11 06:16:35,2,0,2,Home,And at 3 hours long you HAVE to go into that with an amazing attention span I had to watch it for a film class and I almost walked out or fell asleep multiple times For me a very frustrating film Theres definitely great ideas in it it just takes too damn long to get around to them Not to mention the horrible digital format it was shot on making it look like a crappy home movie
2015-05-11 06:16:58,3,0,3,Home,Are you sure she glanced back at him I distinctly remember expecting her to at least acknowledge Caleb as she was walking into the elevator with him screaming and flailing against the glass door behind her and found it absolutely chilling that she did not even glance back That blank expression on her face as the elevator door closes completely epitomizes what the movie was trying to drive home

2015-05-11 08:45:37,1,0,1,Home,Yeah I would agree if there could be any practical reason for the decision in question it would be the reason you gave That reason was still not nearly developed enough within the movies narrative to actual be a full justification though  they really needed to fill that out with more related dialoguescenes and knowledge for the viewer if they wanted to hang their hat on that Even then it would have only been a very minor improvement as the main problem that Ive been hammering home and that you agree with would still be present
2015-05-11 10:00:12,1,0,1,Home,Exactly  I loved the director but the kid really didnt grip me  I wasnt really struck or sympathize with him and in the end the emotional buildup of the movie which I can observe didnt strike home with me  Which is weird because Im both a musician and like powerfully acted movies
2015-05-11 10:08:38,1,0,1,Home,I thought the final shot was showing the true victims us To reflect the uneducated masses shepherded by those willing to take advantage of the powerless The clueless averageJoe the one who lost his home and job in 2009 who thinks 1 expensive motivational lecture instantly transforms a life who says no to drugs and risks who stays in a bad marriage who doesnt have aching incessant egoism who has a moral code and active conscience Who watches movies and critiques not acts

2015-05-11 16:12:23,1,0,1,Home,Having grown up around people with serious pride issues I disagree that this should cause viewers to lose empathy with the character  In my family and my husbands family it is always better to refuse helphandouts and to improve your own life than to be a charity case  My father and his brothers would have chosen to be homeless before ever accepting an unearned dime from someone else or from the government  Its stupid and its shallow but that pride comes from a place of insecurity and a family tradition to never let anyone else take care of you  In that regard I can still empathize with Walter after he turns down the Gray Matter jobeven though its an ignorant decision

2015-05-11 18:55:38,2,0,2,Home,Seriously though Ive been doing my best to vote with my wallet for a while now  I hate theaters  They are dinosaurs that should have gone extinct a while ago  Who actually likes watching a movie in a theater instead of their own home  Yet all these theater organizations force contracts preventing a movie from being released digitally for streaming or even on Bluray all because they know that if there is a easy viable option for watching a movie without their forced horrible customer experience then they will go out of business  I havent watched a movie in a theater in years and will continue not doing so in the hopes that one day I will be givin the option as a consumer to see a movie on my terms and not have them held hostage in an environment of ringing phones loud peoples conversations and overpriced concessions

2015-05-11 19:55:37,0,0,0,Home,The problem with this concept is that critics are NOT word of mouth Word of mouth is how good movies achieve lasting popularity  Critics hate popular comedy and as such any movie that tries to be funny loses ratings from critics but gains popularity  The exception to this is indiecult director style comedies which trade wide popularity for ratings despite the comedy  Fury road looks like it is incredible but I will expect a high budget dramatic cinegraphic epic befitting the type of action movie that recieves critical acclaim  The way you describe it I should expect this to be better than The Dark Knight  When a movie review aggregate comes out that appropriately estimates how popular movies like wheedon scorsese and nolan make will be compared to other movies like wheedon nolan and scorsese movies until that day comes ill be watching from home and waiting on word of mouth

2015-05-11 22:43:55,3,0,3,Home,I dont know about weedcokeheroin but mushrooms just kind of grow around where I grew up so those were never a problem  and lots of people sold weed so that was never a problem Beer was always a problem until I turned 21 though We always had to get it from someones older sibling and sometimes that just isnt easy to do I think weed will become hard for younger people to find if it is legalized based off my experience but only if they legalize it to a point where it is more attractive to grow your own or the store bought isnt a complete rip off Have to consider for lots of people convenience of buying at a store on way home is worth paying a little extra so it doesnt have to be cheaper than street prices But ya  prohibition in some ways makes it easier to get things while having distribution and sale regulated and controlled by the government makes it not only more difficult to get for underage people but it also cuts out the criminal element and provides a safer more consistent and higher quality product to consumers because competition is good for consumers I think that people are realizing this and how much of a massive failure the War on Drugs has been Ill be happy when it is legalized because I wouldnt mind smoking a little every now and then but dont right now because of mine and my wifes jobs Cant really risk the legal repercussions if ever caught

2015-05-16 00:12:51,1,0,1,Home,I loved the movie although I felt so much of the subplots were rushed siting Thors dip in the pool scene as just one example Hopefully these will be flushed out in the next Thor movie and likewise to the other unanswered solo hero interludes in their individual movies or not What I did like were those particular scenes like when Iron man Vision and Thor were beaming their rays and lightening at Ultron creating a cutout straight from the comic book pages kind of a work of art That was exciting for me Yes the story was kind of fluff but so were many of the stories in the comic books With that said there was a guy behind me snoring through most of the movie Really Why go to the movie to sleep This along with all the loud and selfindulgent kids and tweens is why I rarely go to the movies anymore I cant wait to see this again at home on my giant TV in 3D without the snoring
2015-05-16 00:29:56,1,0,1,Home,Just watched this movie not an hour ago I felt that the sound track was one of the few things that held this movie back for me It seemed so mild in comparison to the gritty landscape that visually was there I would have very much appreciated it more if the music was as raw as the way every other part of the movie was yet it felt so canned and unoriginal On the way home from the theater my buddy and I listened to Lightning Bolt and thought how a feel as heavy and unpolished as that would have complimented some of those battle scenes
2015-05-16 00:52:47,85,0,85,Home,Saw it late last night and thought about the movie throughout the entire day It is definitely one of the better movies Ive seen in a while It triggered a pretty good debate between my girlfriend and I on the ride home from the movie on the pros and cons of AI Loved how thought provoking the movie was and the way it was filmed Just as you said it keeps you mystified as to which direction it will take who exactly is playing who Oscar Isaac crushed it Ill be encouraging others to see it no doubt
2015-05-16 00:55:29,49,0,49,Home,I just came home from seeing it It was great Best action movie Ive seen since Dredd I really hope were going to be seeing more finely crafted action films like this in the future
2015-05-16 01:19:22,3,0,3,Home,A newer one is A Girl Walks Home Alone at Night Its Iranian I think so you will need subtitles But man does it ooze coolness Its fucking cool The soundtrack the characters the overall look and feel It will definitely hit the spot youre looking to hit 100 guarantee
2015-05-16 02:05:02,61,0,61,Home,Stop it George Miller youre setting the action movie standards too high I just got home and am still in awe of how good the movie was I have never seen a movie twice in theaters but I am seriously considering going back and giving it a second watch

2015-05-16 02:43:35,7,0,7,Home,Just came home from a screening and was absolutely blown away
2015-05-16 04:45:21,1,0,1,Home,Buddy of mine said its different meaning he was saving face and wasnt his thing I loved it My wife wouldnt care for it but I feel this is a carefully carvedout masterpiece I have a 5 speed so my driving was a bit irrational on the way home  So the next installment Imperator Furiosa protects the utopia from invaders perhaps
2015-05-16 04:52:23,1,0,1,Home,9 is great Elijah Wood forever Also when it first came out I watched it while babysitting young kids and they didnt want to go to bed until their mom got home ha
2015-05-16 04:52:27,2,0,2,Home,Just got home and the movie was out of this world  Easily made my top ten list Im still in awe
2015-05-16 04:52:45,-4,0,-4,Home,Even then it was all so that she could return home herselr
2015-05-16 04:56:50,-2,0,-2,Home,Why not The quality of smartphone screens excels a lot of home televisions
2015-05-16 04:57:42,1,0,1,Home,Kid Eternity one of  Peter Pans lost boys wants to go home so he can grow up He is visited by the ghost of JM Barrie who Thales him on a Dante inspired tour of what he can expect as he passes though the levels of adulthood
2015-05-16 05:09:06,1,0,1,Home,After finishing this movie I got home and immediately had to listen to some slayer Goddamn that was a fucking metal movie and I primarily listen to rap Seriously amazing movie I cant wait to see where Miller takes the rest of the movies
2015-05-16 05:41:47,47,0,47,Home,Definitely my favorite Valhalla Awaits is good too I hadnt even left the theater  last night before I whipped out my phone and started downloading the soundtrack I had to drive about 35 miles home on Texas back roads while listening to it at 1 am My wife was terrified but I couldnt help myself
2015-05-16 06:13:30,4,0,4,Home,Same here Furiosas realization that her home was lost the sacrifice of Nux and his moments with Capable Maxs final redemption there were a lot of really emotionally powerful moments
2015-05-16 07:02:05,2,0,2,Home,Thats actually what I did haha After my friends all left the mall to go home I snuck into the theater to see it again
2015-05-16 07:29:07,12,0,12,Home,But you saw what happens when Max falls asleep and what he daydreams about Hes haunted Every single Mad Max film ends with him drifting back into the wasteland Hes not ready to move on What hes looking for is not a new home Max is looking for a state of serenity
2015-05-16 07:56:44,1,0,1,Home,I personally really enjoyed it Seeing it in theaters was an experience but I still really enjoyed it when I watched again a couple months later at home Your friend knows you better than I do but I thought Gone Girl was amazingly well done
2015-05-16 07:59:22,4,0,4,Home,On the way home I hit 90 on the onramp to the highway I was fucking pumped Later I realized that was unreasonable and kept my speed at 80
2015-05-16 08:05:23,4,0,4,Home,Yup The night of when I watched it I was seriously scared of that shit happening to me I felt so paranoid driving home
2015-05-16 09:23:42,25,0,25,Home,Wouldnt this be the idea of prop department or whomever responsible
2015-05-16 09:24:13,2,0,2,Home,I unfortunately had the opposite the 3 friends i dragged along with me were all sorts of meh after Like they enjoyed it but i wanted to leave the theater and just rave with them the whole ride home istead I just listened to the smallest gripes and complaining and kept quiet 3 on 1 i felt timid hahah But i couldnt get over it how much i just really enjoyed it Im debating whether i thought it was actually a 98 on rotten tomatoes and i think so maybe like 95 just cause i felt that Furiosa could have just a TAD more back story to sell her defection still i felt her pain
2015-05-16 09:25:45,4,0,4,Home,It reminds me of God Emperor Of Dune  Leto discusses how in male dominated societies the elder alpha males send younger unattached males out to fight resource warsraids against their neighbors while they sit at home with all the females of breeding age  Armies in this case became fixated on homoerotic fantasies and end up raping and pillaging the populations they were intended to protect  Female dominated societies produce armies where the goal is social cohesion and they use sex to tame rogue males  turning rape from a weapon used against them into a tool to control potentially violent males
2015-05-16 10:25:23,5,0,5,Home,First off  Im so glad you call Australia home being an Australian myself I was born here but you are as Australian as I no matter where you came from Second off  I apologise for our idiotic politicians who hate refugees and immigrants Im sure this country looks like a bunch of wankers internationally But I digress
2015-05-16 11:05:21,2,0,2,Home,I thought it was home but Im not certain
2015-05-16 11:44:50,3,0,3,Home,Well that goes back to when Michael Bond conceived of the character he thought of the children back then Mr Gruber was no doubt an invention for the film simply to drive home that point The parallel was always there from Paddington Bears conception though
2015-05-16 12:03:18,4,0,4,Home,In the french version she said take them home so probably something like that
2015-05-16 13:43:03,1,0,1,Home,Jumanji was filmed in my hometown Ill always love that flick We still have the Parish Shoe sign in the town centre
2015-05-16 13:48:51,12,0,12,Home,I sat in my car for about 510 minutes after the movie ended because I had to come down from all of the adrenaline The whole ride home I kept thinking that I need to find a desert area and drive wildly through it
2015-05-16 14:11:27,25,0,25,Home,I went home after the movie and had a Black Mirror marathon based on a recommendation in an Ex Machina thread It was incredible and I had a wonderful Sci Fi Sunday
2015-05-16 14:29:41,7,0,7,Home,Same feeling I was racing down the streets to get home Glad I wasnt stopped by any cops may have been a heavy ticket
2015-05-16 14:33:37,14,0,14,Home,Nope The BO gross and theatre number are just increasing over the years People go to theatres not for movies themselves but for this specific experience that you just cant get at home It doesnt matter if the movie is available on the web or dvd its not the same
2015-05-16 14:35:13,3,0,3,Home,Some people just want to watch a film so they are doing it from the comforts of their own home Others go in for the experience and so they like the movie theater
2015-05-16 14:49:56,1,0,1,Home,I could answer these questions and respond to your other comments but it just seems like you went to the wrong theater to see this movie  You seemed to have missed a lot and you need a 2nd viewing  I dont mean this in a negative way  Its happened to me before and I think that I might cheapen your experience for you  I highly suggest watching it again  It sucks that someone feels this way about such a great piece of work  I dont think youll feel the same upon a second viewing at a better theater or with a Blu Ray on a GOOD Blu Ray player like an Xbox 1 where the audio is fixed  Happened to me with Dark Knight Rises  I loved it in the theater but when watching it on Blu Ray at home I realized that it was the best of the series and not Dark Knight with the Joker
2015-05-16 15:00:21,0,0,0,Home,Actually I like to relax at home
2015-05-16 15:14:12,1,0,1,Home,Wait how did you see it at home Isnt it still in theaters
2015-05-16 15:22:13,1,0,1,Home,I think it all really depends on how fast technology will change Right now large HD televisions have become insanely cheep As time progresses they will only become better and cheaper making it more common for people to have high quality theaters in their homes I think once that happens sales will exponentially decrease until only theaters that offer something completely unique will be left At that point it would probably make sense for the film industry to actually make the change
2015-05-16 15:30:21,3,0,3,Home,I think theaters will still be around for the next few decades  but ticket prices keep increasing as attendance each year drops While home theater options keep getting better and cheaper
2015-05-16 15:43:18,-15,0,-15,Home,Yep dont believe it exists  I think that if we decided as a country that being able to stay at home with our family instead of long hours at a job we would be in a matriarchy  So which is it are we in a matriarchy or a patriarchy
2015-05-16 15:49:05,2,0,2,Home,It might also be becauses Caleb only changed the lockdown procedure for the next powerout meaning if things didnt go as planned the next power out would disable Nathan from continuing his work and lock him inside his home Another possibility is that when Caleb tries to use the computer after Ava left he triggered a security measure that was designed by Nathan to prevent other people for accessing the computer didnt Caleb use his own card on the computer after Ava left and only Nathan wouldve known how to reverse it Also Nathan did have a habit of drinking too much so it would make sense to have special security in case he would get hammered while he had a guest visiting Its hard to say why he didnt have biometrics in his security system Its either the limitations of the location that Norwegian hotel and that the budget was only 11 million euros good looking CGI is expensive for one or that the script writer found biometrics lacking like fingers could be cut off eyes could be clawed out voice could get damaged etc Maybe the key card required a living human holding it by having sensors that recognized the electrical impulses coming from living skin and that way none of the robots could use it Nathan was originally living with just robots that he made after all Either way Im sure even the security was carefully thought out because everyone knows that biometrics exist and still they resolved to use keycards EDIT I just realized that maybe the system just resets to default after a powerout so any code Caleb wrote would be deleted Just guessing though Ive never been a coder
2015-05-16 16:04:14,15,0,15,Home,I think its valid not that someones subjective opinion of a movie needs to be validated to critique Ex Machina for this detail Its pretty out of character for a guy who is a genius when it comes to technology and who deeply values his privacy and security to have such a massive hole in his home security system and this hole in the security system plays a major part in the climax of the film That being said its also perfectly valid to willingly suspend your disbelief for this I did and I enjoyed the movie But there have been plenty times an otherwise decent movie has been ruined for me due to a detail like this one
2015-05-16 16:23:12,8,0,8,Home,My ex got me into Black Mirror Hands down whomever the video graphic editorsanimators are for that show are absolutely the best I have ever seen The stuff they do is fucking amazing
2015-05-16 17:02:23,0,0,0,Home,Can I ask how youre already able to watch it at home and hit pause on it
2015-05-16 17:50:35,1,0,1,Home,I probably should have rephrased it to how are you already watching it at home in good quality
2015-05-16 19:20:27,3,0,3,Home,A Girl Walks Home Alone at Night
2015-05-16 19:29:07,0,0,0,Home,Just got back home from it Ill give it an 810 Very good but slightly overrated imo
2015-05-16 19:44:34,1,0,1,Home,Take Me Home Tonight
2015-05-16 19:57:37,1,0,1,Home,The theater advertised Sony 4k projection before the trailers stayed and I would believe it from some of the trailers I guess it all makes sense then At least I wasnt the only one I feel I dont get anything more from a 2k file projected than from a home Bluray Maybe Im just getting too old to see the point I can wait
2015-05-16 21:15:25,2,0,2,Home,Im with you I just look at it like a pretty critical character flaw Perhaps Nathan was just a bit too overconfident in his home security that prevents people from getting in add a dash of complacency and voila you have your climax
2015-05-16 21:51:13,2,0,2,Home,Im really glad I saw it in the cinema I dont think it would be the same at home but I cant say Im dying to see it again I loved Max though I loved how he always gave people a are you fucking serious look and then just went on with whatever was being proposed
2015-05-16 22:02:12,1,0,1,Home,I was watching it at home   Id read a few articles that raved about it but it just wasnt holding my attention
2015-05-16 22:29:24,3,0,3,Home,I think it is the song that makes me want to see this film but the concept seems a bit stupid She doesnt have to be a stay at home mother I am confused by this premise
2015-05-16 23:23:57,1,0,1,Home,I saw it with a bunch of friends we all had a great time we laughed and cried and cringed at all the moments we were supposed to Got home read the reviews thought I must be going crazy
2015-05-16 23:57:08,-2,0,-2,Home,Yeah a lot of movies only do well once they hit the home video marketbut it still needs to make another 110 million dollars before theyll even get a return on their investment
2015-05-16 23:57:49,0,0,0,Home,Ok Hollywood make the Great Lakes Avengers movie cast Rebel Wilson as Big Bertha and take home all the money in the world
2015-05-17 00:38:10,2,0,2,Home,At least you have a SUV it was hard playing Furiosa on the way home in my Honda Civic
2015-05-17 00:45:35,21,0,21,Home,I just came home from watching the film this evening
2015-05-17 00:55:41,31,0,31,Home,I see my comment made it Is there a home version I want to show my dying grandma this before she goes to god so she can tell god about Mad Max Fury Road and how it needs to do good at the box office to get more rated r underrated gems
2015-05-17 01:01:21,16,0,16,Home,The production team and I discussed this but we felt a home version would simply be more time wasted that wasnt spent in the theater watching Mad Max Fury Road
2015-05-17 01:37:31,-1,0,-1,Home,How did you watch at homepause a movie still in theaters
2015-05-17 01:41:23,9,0,9,Home,This is all every experimental for me Im trying new styles and growing as an artist Some will be Home Runs others not so much 1 for the constructive criticism though
2015-05-17 01:46:43,2,0,2,Home,Im in sort of the same boat man I really wanted to like the movie and I really did initially but shortly after i got home I realized there wasnt much of substance for me to cling onto with the movie and i feel overall that itll just pass away as another movie I saw This is probably because I really didnt like the story or for that matter Furiosa Before i get labeled a misogynists it wasnt that i felt she shouldnt have been in the role that she was but her character was off to me She felt so outside of the Mad Max universe with how she acted and every word of dialogue missing a lot of the Mad Max way of speech that so many characters use The whole story sort of fell in place and really dragged with the long action scenes taking most of the movies run time leaving to watching a lot of the same shit over and over again I was really hoping to like it but its just a okay movie to me nothing to go back to at a later date
2015-05-17 01:54:27,-4,0,-4,Home,If you can guarantee me a clean comfortable seat with no annoying kids and people on their cell phones and good affordable home made food and beverages with no strange smells and spoilerladen previews then sure

2015-05-17 02:29:43,4,0,4,Home,Beautiful insanity I know that it wont happen but there needs to be a big budget Oscar category or a stunt category This film would take them both home
2015-05-17 02:35:03,1,0,1,Home,I think they typically take a long time to reach theatershome release Sorry I dont know a release window
2015-05-17 03:44:03,1,0,1,Home,Just watched this the other day Great movie the torture scenes were super intense for me to watch but it had problems Mainly Brent is such a fucking idiot he deserves everything that happened Like keep running dont hide in a tree Also no hospital trips at the end Just gonna go home Gotcha
2015-05-17 05:31:10,10,0,10,Home,I just got home from it  While I did really enjoy it I counted no less than 3 guys wearing fedoras in my theater  That seems about right in line with some of these comments
2015-05-17 06:32:37,3,0,3,Home,Seen all the Mad Max movies Just came home from it and popping Road Warrior in Sadly from a plot standpoint its inferior to RW
2015-05-17 07:08:18,1,0,1,Home,My brother was so scared on the ride home from the theatre as i played the soundtrack from youtube and started zooming through cars and changing lanes I was a little extra with the steering wheel and aggressive with my starts and stops but I stayed within the sped limit haha
2015-05-17 07:46:14,-4,0,-4,Home,Still ya gotta admit A Warboy would look right at home on Pandora
2015-05-17 08:30:34,2,0,2,Home,Much bigger trouble in littler tiny Chinatown Go big or go home
2015-05-17 10:26:19,1,0,1,Home,Award season will help this film out as well Its one of the best reviewed blockbusters in a long long time let alone a Rrated action scifi movie After Kingsman showed its legs with positive word of mouth theres no reason to doubt that Fury Road will perform even better Itll walk away with a handful of technical Oscars and more than likely be a player for best picture and director The home sales are going to have legs too
2015-05-17 11:03:10,4,0,4,Home,That sort of happened in the books as well Only in the books its actually longer after the first ending in Gondor after Sauron is defeated theres a quite a bit of the book left with the Hobbits dealing with the problems back home which wasnt in the movies at all
2015-05-17 11:26:12,1,0,1,Home,We were talking about that on the way home In a world where petrol is scarce why is everyone driving souped up petrolguzzlers Surely everyone would be driving Smart cars and the like They may not hit 100mph but at least theyre fuel efficient enough to get you to and from the battle Add some spikes and skulls and Im sure you can make them look badass enough
2015-05-17 12:56:43,1,0,1,Home,Given a nice large projector room versus the terrible cinemas here Id say home viewing is better Food company comfort control cost and more
2015-05-17 13:07:11,1,0,1,Home,From my experience home viewing is never better and Ive been in some 10 grand home theatres it just doesnt live up But whatever floats your boat mate enjoy
2015-05-17 13:15:15,1,0,1,Home,The Sylvain Chomet animated films are some of the best animated films ever The Illusionist and Triplets of Belville are both great
2015-05-17 16:09:50,254,0,254,Home,American Sniper Completely divorced from the bigger discussions about the films take on veterans and American at war and about the authors purported fabrication of elements of the story I just thought the film wasnt particularly good Bradley Coopers performance was fine but the script was super rushedthey tried to fit in background three tours of duty and three stops back home between those tours into one film which made the whole thing feel rushed I felt like there wasnt enough time to invest in Coopers character so it was hard to chart the changes that his character was supposed to be going through and in turn hard to sympathize with him The tone of the story waffled toois this a gritty realistic account of war or a shootemup with bad guys The movie ended incredibly abruptly too which is not to mention the absurdity in the final scene no spoilers of a war veteran teasing his wife by pointing a real gun at her That all mixed in with other ridiculous quirks of the film including the plastic baby debacle among other things made me pretty baffled to hear that it was the highestgrossing war film of all time
2015-05-17 16:13:27,1,0,1,Home,Gravity is a movie to watch in 3D at the movies I watched it at home a couple months later and I wasnt as fascinated
2015-05-17 16:21:45,1,0,1,Home,Fair enough Two movies not on your list that I could recommend would be It Follows and A Girl Walks Home Alone At Night Check those out if you havent watched either of them yet
2015-05-17 16:27:19,1,0,1,Home,A Girl Walks Home Alone at Night This was the most boring movie I have ever watched Artsy hipster crap Had some interesting scenes and was shot very well Thats about it I couldnt finish it Nothing happens
2015-05-17 16:33:16,-2,0,-2,Home,ask my friend  I left to go smoke then texted him from the cab home telling him they wouldnt let me back in because I lost my stub
2015-05-17 16:46:17,0,0,0,Home,My vote too I found the lack of the uncanny valley feeling very interesting I wont add on to that to avoid spoilers but that is a thought I has after I got back home from the theater
2015-05-17 16:50:26,0,0,0,Home,The ET bit makes complete sense he couldnt be 2 places at once that is unless its after everything and leads to the were home of the new trailers
2015-05-17 17:22:34,0,0,0,Home,I lucked out when I saw it where I literally knew nothing about it going in I didnt even know it existed until I tagged  along with some friends to see it I often think if I had heard all of the press reviews and what it was about later and maybe watched it at home I probably wouldnt have liked it nearly as much
2015-05-17 17:23:36,75,0,75,Home,Too me it felt like one of those films made for Sarah Palins Real Americans Rambling downhome badboy cowboy becomes patriotic and goes out and acts like superman on the battlefield killing super evil muslims by the handful I felt like I should have wrapped myself in an American flag and masterbating to how great we are while watching it
2015-05-17 17:32:05,13,0,13,Home,I did get some of that vibe but going into it the pitch I heard was that it was going to be another of Eastwoods films that examine wars lasting personal damage in times of peace or at least the relative peace of returning home from a tour of service I was expecting a thoughtprovoking character piece but didnt really get that for the reasons I mentioned above
2015-05-17 17:50:53,2,0,2,Home,Ex Machina already made its money back Please see Mad Max Fury Road in 3D because I need a sequel in my life Plus it was incredible and would definitely be diluted in a home video scenario
2015-05-17 18:15:25,1,0,1,Home,That is the kind of point I am looking for Whether or not waiting for home video will ruin it
2015-05-17 18:19:16,11,0,11,Home,also the inspiration for home alone 2 RIP FAOS
2015-05-17 18:23:27,1,0,1,Home,Our society is patriarchal I must have missed the news of the government passing laws to prevent women from working or leaving the home or allowing women to be discriminated against based on their gender or blocking them from getting an education owning property or a business and generally relegating them to a secondclass status All the women involved in government working as doctors scientists and in business must have disappeared
2015-05-17 18:29:44,2,0,2,Home,It will absolutely ruin your impression of the movie to wait for home video like waiting to see one of The Hobbit movies would The scale is GIGANTIC The 3D is subtle but fantastic though I know some people dont care for that
2015-05-17 18:59:20,1,0,1,Home,Kind of problematic that its a 180 degree change at home vs theater dont you think
2015-05-17 19:02:52,1,0,1,Home,Skyfall The action sequences were hugely entertaining and the visuals breathtaking in many instances but the premise was just so ridiculous that I remember leaving the cinema with mixed feelings and wondering how the movie received such rave reviews from critics I couldnt reconcile the gritty realism seriousness and closeted angst of the new Bond with the uncharacteristic smallmindedness of the villain who pretty much just wanted revenge and went to such extreme contrived lengths to lure Bond to an island so he could get captured hack M16 and assassinate M Then the whole thing with the estate in the countryside seemed pretty ludicrous to me as well Maybe in time Ill grow to appreciate it along with the other films but Ill always remember how much of a letdown it was to realize that Skyfall wasnt the code name for some epic climactic plot to bring down the world economy or something on that scale but the name of Bonds childhood home It just didnt feel like a Bond film at all more like a Bond side story Really looking forward to SPECTRE though
2015-05-17 19:14:28,1,0,1,Home,Basically this is the entire reason that TVs have gotten larger My 27 CRT when I was like 18 was awesome but I was pretty jelly of my friend with the 32 Trinitron Now my 55 LED is small VR headset  all the advantages of having a massive TV or projector screen for a home theatre except without having to cover an entire wall with a massive TV

2015-05-17 19:46:44,0,0,0,Home,Agreed Its one of those movies that is only pretty good once when you see it in the theater You know it will be boring as hell on your screen at home And mediocre writing is something I can never ignore in a film along with a lot of very convenient movie moments how long can she keep on running out of oxygen for for Gods sake
2015-05-17 19:57:45,2,0,2,Home,The Pact 2012 Cant remember where I heard of this but its a pretty good horror film A young woman investigates the disappearance of her sister and finds out that something is not right in the family home I fucking hated the end twist but other than that I have no reservations
2015-05-17 19:58:01,2,0,2,Home,For all intensive purposes American Sniper did achieve what I wanted to see in this movie and it is a stirling character piece The problem is Clint Eastwoods film making cuts corners so people focus on that and not the story of a man who went to combat claimed to kill 300 people and then came home to the ire of the American people who discovered what a horrible sham the Iraq war was
2015-05-17 20:09:54,7,0,7,Home,A lot of veterans have it out for this flick but that one scene made the whole movie for me That scene FELT exactly like coming home felt for me There is no other scene in any other movie I can point to and its a really hard feeling to try to convey to people

2015-05-18 15:16:03,23,0,23,Home,I think this is gotta be up near the top despite whatever people thought of the movie because the trailer had NO title no nothing  I cant even remember what movie it was attached too but I remember running home afterwards and scouring the IMDB forums for anything  The name was leaked and spread immediately through online forums  It was such a unique approach to advertising at the time

2015-05-18 20:38:45,1,0,1,Home,Im not saying its perfect  But the reception though long does serve a purpose  The russian roulette scene becomes so much more intense after watching those characters back home in a normal scenario  Could you imagine being forced to play russian roulette with your best friends

2015-05-18 23:40:16,3,0,3,Home,No more than the various human or other race tribes And that too only in their own homeland I like it when fantasy races are at least a bit fundamentally alien to humans and not just essentially recolored human societies
2015-05-18 23:47:08,-2,0,-2,Home,I enjoyed the movie for what it was but I feel its being overrated I really appreciated that he didnt overly rely on CGI for the vehicle chasebattles and stunts The bizarro characters were colorful That being said I found the way people not only survive but walk away unscathed from the most outlandish car crashes to be distracting and took me out of the movie Also could someone explain why possible spoliers that War Boy needed Max to come along as his blood bag on their chase And what the point was for possible spoilers Furiosas homegirl to be hanging out on top of the tower naked screaming for help Max said she was bait Bait for whom and what was the trap Do those things make any sense to anyone or maybe they dont but no one cares For me I found myself going huh too much throughout to movie to lavish the kind of praise its getting right now

2015-05-19 05:26:32,2,0,2,Home,Yeah the movie was inspired by that but in the film he purposefully made her less sick and made the protagonists two girls and not two boys in order to make the film less difficult for him to make Notice that their mother returns home during the credits
2015-05-19 05:35:59,15,0,15,Home,What about the part where a guy was forced to live in an airport for years instead of being able to return to his home country or leave and go to America
2015-05-19 05:54:53,7,0,7,Home,I havent seen that movie but I had a similar experience with The Ring I kept imagining that the girl was going to suddenly show up in my house while I was home alone I started talking aloud to make myself feel brave and laugh about how ridiculous it was Im sure anyone would think it was ridiculous to hear a grown woman shouting Yeah you wet bitch just try to come out of my TV I will fuck you up but it worked I dont watch scary movies any more though
2015-05-19 06:10:20,0,0,0,Home,Yeah but Miyazakis mom was back and forth between the hospital throughout his childhood as well I always took the ending to be more she got well enough to be at home for the time being not she got all better and joined the racquetball team you know
2015-05-19 06:47:52,0,0,0,Home,I dont agree with that If we were purely talking about showing Walters descent from wellmeaning teacher to murderous psychopathic drug lord then yeah it could have been done in a mediumlong thriller movie but the show also shows us Jesses transformation the massive impacts Walters actions have on his family the Cousins entering his home Hanks hospital time all that sort of stuff If it was a movie all that would be cut out or very marginalised I dont really think there was much filler in Breaking Bad that didnt contribute to character development or the story Even Fly which seems to be the least liked episode because it doesnt have anything that affects the plot is a pure character study episode that examines the relationship between Walter and Jesse
2015-05-19 06:49:29,1,0,1,Home,If you knew how it worked you wouldnt have used it being high on the list lying about it being the first result as an argument for its validity And I never said Jackson didnt invite him to his home I said the guy running the blog actually believed he is in The Hobbit I read a few posts there and its nothing but speculation and honestly hatred Its a very odd blog and offers nothing in terms of evidence which is what matters
2015-05-19 08:30:03,8,0,8,Home,Theres pretty much one film per decade there These top tens seem to have one or 2 deep films  with the other 8 being popcorn fillers Honestly I prefer to watch deep films at home so I can talk about it  pause it or otherwise get up to piss without missing a key point
2015-05-19 08:49:06,76,0,76,Home,So My husband and I found an old photograph of his grandfather when he was a child He was all decked out in a stylish cowboy costume complete with leather tassels and toy guns My husband told me that his grandfather has always loved westerns and has been what we would call today a fanboy of western movies his entire life Now that hes retired there are old westerns playing on his television from the moment he wakes up until he goes to bed He also has or had quite a few signed photographs of famous western actors in his home as well as memorabilia Something about his grandfathers history struck a cord with me because romanticized western culture never quite makes it into the larger discussion of fan culture I focus on fan culture due to the common connection in contemporary avenues between young adultsimmaturity and fandom Now what that story made me realize is that fan culture has existed for much longer than we give it credit for While westerns may seem dramatic and serious they are highly romanticized and take on the same hero fantasy that is commonly seen in the comic books and fantasy novels created after them and may have singlehandedly spawned the comic book genre Now I feel that anyone looking at his grandfather would never see him as childish for his love of westerns Hes a military veteran a carpenter and a family man with a cowboys dry humor I can only imagine this developed from the large amount of Westerns he has watched since his youth So the question becomes why is there a difference between nostalgic immaturity in entertainment in his era as compared to our own Why is his entertainment not generally seen as childish when it entails all of the same tropes as the current comic book movies and medieval adventure epics that grace our theaters today
2015-05-19 09:58:47,1,0,1,Home,I put this one on when I was home alone I loved it so much Such a great premise for a movie
2015-05-19 10:15:46,11,0,11,Home,It says in the book that he thinned out his group of Lost Boys if they got too old He wasnt taking them back home
2015-05-19 10:30:50,-2,0,-2,Home,Its never stated whether he killed them or took them back home Its a fan theory nothing more
2015-05-19 11:22:58,2,0,2,Home,I think the image is somewhat distorted by the focus we place on box office revenue As the cost of cinema tickets went up I started limiting my cinema visits to films I thought would really benefit from a big screen The Hobbit and the Avengers come to mind  These films are also less likely to be ruined by an inconsiderate cinema goer being in your vicinity  I watch emotional or intelligent films at home on a smaller screen for a fraction of the cost
2015-05-19 11:23:09,2,0,2,Home,FDR American badass  was so bad it took something from me That was a movie so horrible that it changed my definition of failure not just for movies but for life altogether When I think about the fact that a large group of people got together and did the things in that film and then went home to their families and had to look them them in the eye and tell them what they did it fills me with the most profound mixture of rage and sorrow
2015-05-19 11:23:37,-2,0,-2,Home,Yeah granny Back to care home NOW
2015-05-19 11:51:56,2,0,2,Home,Ummm what are you talking about I dont know where you live but in my area adult dramas like Noble The Water Diviner Far from the Madding Crowd Woman in Gold and The Age of Adaline are all currently in wide release Then theres two stupid comedies hot pursuit Paul Blart one kids movie which are usually better than adult dramas anyway although Home which is currently in theaters probably is not whatever Pitch Perfect 2 is a postapocalyptic 80s action movie Mad Max and a superhero movie Avengers I know you were being hyperbolic about multiplexes being half superhero genre flicks but still we only have three or four a year is more emblematic of a modern trend than some sort of cultural genocide Treatment of females in movies overuse of digital instead of film stock and expensive 3D are more viral and more concerning trends in film
2015-05-19 12:31:33,1,0,1,Home,The Cabin in the Woods is still on there I believe I havent seen it yet but I have heard great things about A Girl Walks Home Alone at Night The Exorcist is on there Tucker and Dale vs Evil is on there Not necessarily a horror film but its a lot of fun and it plays with horror clichs Grabbers is a fun little Irish monster film If you like films like Shaun of the Dead then you will enjoy Grabbers Event Horizon is a decent SciFi horror film Let the Right One In is absolutely great The Omen is on there Classic horror right there
2015-05-19 12:36:05,4,0,4,Home,There are some pretty complex themes in the Marvel universe if you know where to look for them  Im a teacher and I taught a whole class on The Winter Soldier  They had to watch it for homework and then prepare a short talk and essay on what the actual difference between Captain America and Hydra was  Most students actually missed the mark they talked about obvious stuff like bravery heroism friendship selfsacrifice etc  But when I pointed out that villains can exhibit all those traits too most students were stymied  Only a few of them really nailed it and even then only after prompting  The movies can be about a lot more than Hulk fights a robot  I bet I could get some great discussion material from Age of Ultron too  Maybe I will when it comes out on DVD
2015-05-19 12:43:00,3,0,3,Home,I have been thinking about a human proble people accept the world as it is and dont fight to make it a better place  People at best shrug their shoulders and bitch on Reddit   A little bit of corruption seems like the grease that makes the world work  Just rubber stamp this paperwork  no one will know no one will blame you if they did know  You re no paragon like Captain America so just go along and go home and watch your escapism and imagine this superhuman saving you  Its better that way  Go to bed  you will feel better in the morning
2015-05-19 13:24:22,3,0,3,Home,Id say the second was the worst I just never felt like much happened Really drove home how it didnt need to be 3 films
2015-05-19 13:37:28,183,0,183,Home,to go home and give it a try
2015-05-19 13:45:26,3,0,3,Home,Personally I no longer see the point of going to the cinema for a drama or comedy Theres simply no benefit to seeing someones face so big that if I put my hand on the screen it could fit in a pore I may as well just watch it at home save 20 a be able to pause the film to make more popcorn whenever I want
2015-05-19 13:47:52,1,0,1,Home,Fair enough but realize you are missing out on one of them  Its actually a very good film  I went in expecting crap and was surprised  His awkwardness and delivery are perfect for the role in the film  he plays a guy who writes travel guide books for business travelers so they can feel like they never left home
2015-05-19 14:18:39,2,0,2,Home,This movie was incredibly surreal to me because it was shot in my hometown Watching it was the strangest thing to watch They didnt change the name of the town but did say that it was in the states rather than in canada Watching it seemed like watching some alternate reality and really stopped me from becoming immersed Never experienced anything like it before
2015-05-19 15:02:10,1,0,1,Home,That movie has an amazing feel throughout  Its a combination of the subtle sound effects and dreamlike nature that drives it home as a dark twisted fantasy movie  That and Brick are some of my favorite interpretations of modern noir
2015-05-19 15:21:38,2,0,2,Home,I thought it was straight to home video at first
2015-05-19 15:38:59,15,0,15,Home,Enders Game spoilerss This is not a game  The kids in the story think theyre playing games to later become generals and admirals of the war against the buggers  The games arent games though theyre really controlling the fleet of Earth as it attacks the bugger home world  So it really isnt a game
2015-05-19 15:39:15,0,0,0,Home,But this does not indicate what those adults watch at home
2015-05-19 15:40:54,1,0,1,Home,So what Peggs point is that society is watching these things less Which simply basing that on what is in theaters is stupid Adults are more often than not going to want to watch something at home especially if its something challenging So yes I can agree we arent going to theaters to see these types of film anymore it doesnt mean we arent watching them it just means we are consuming them differently
2015-05-19 17:21:46,1,0,1,Home,Ehh I feel like people are against it morally but they dont care enough to do anything about it  Its an I want homeless people to have houses but Im not going to build them sort of thing
2015-05-19 19:28:49,-1,0,-1,Home,Yeah I wont see it in theaters but I will see it when its available at home just for Rockwell He is the best
2015-05-19 20:18:27,3,0,3,Home,Hope they film in Pittsburgh again as it was cool to see my hometown on the big screen in all its glory
2015-05-19 20:26:25,46,0,46,Home,I felt like they just wasted a lot of time  Too much time explaining Jupiters home life  Too much time on action sequences  Too much time on the romance which had a really weak conflict anyway
2015-05-19 20:44:54,23,0,23,Home,ItIt Follows me home on DVD
2015-05-19 20:49:31,2,0,2,Home,gt The first problem is that people have already grown accustomed to seeing science fantasy as science fiction Many folks have this odd idea that the laws of physics are somehow constraints to creativity which just goes to show how little they understand about physics I suppose Beyond even that though theres the fact that those same people are happy to accept things like Tony Stark rediscovering a new stable element in the course of an afternoon and with parts bought at Home Depot no less
2015-05-19 21:34:58,10,0,10,Home,It doesnt need to be remade The themes and dialogue explored in the 80s are still perfectly relevant today Watch the first half hour when they talk about the 1 the homeless and modern consumerism It couldve been written yesterday
2015-05-19 21:56:26,1,0,1,Home,Sack of Stormwind King Llane and the fall of Azeroth  never forget Orcs go home

2015-05-19 22:40:01,1,0,1,Home,I was going to go home and continue on my Mad Max kick by watching Thunderdome but then I remembered that I have a copy of The Rover and decided to do that instead Both are Australian films that take place in a post apocalyptic setting so I think Ill still get my fix
2015-05-19 22:44:00,3,0,3,Home,Watched this at a film festival with like concert speakers The soundtrack is amazing If youre watching this at home put the sound on the good stereo and crank the volume makes certain parts of this movie pretty intense
2015-05-19 22:45:47,1,0,1,Home,Every single teenage actor in the film was either a skateboarder who director Larry Clark met in NYC skateparks or else they were friends of writer Harmony Korines 19 at the time Some of the kids Rosario Dawson for instance were found outside their homes In Dawsons case she was sitting on her stoop Harm and Larry drove by and asked her to be in the film They werent supposed to be intimidating many of them ended up being depicted as selfobsessed selfsabotaging and in some cases cowardly
2015-05-19 23:07:21,1,0,1,Home,Ok stop with the lurid pms Not cool or funny Go do your homework
2015-05-19 23:19:46,1,0,1,Home,Oh dont mistake me I think The Avengers et al are good movies sometimes even great in that they are entertaining event films that demand a big screen an audience atmosphere and surround sound The point Im trying to make is I dont think the theater setting is the optimal place to tell challenging and artistic films as much as it used to be Things like that are far more better consumed in the comfort of the home Imagine seeing something like Death of a Salesman at some giant concert venue vs a intimate theater where you can really see the actors Does the concert venue really indicate that people enjoy and seek that content out Itd be like judging the popularity of art by how many people go to art museums rather than how many people go to art museums and actually own and enjoy art
2015-05-19 23:28:11,1,0,1,Home,PS Im sorry for where you live if that is the case for your options when it comes to film Within walking distance of my home I can see any number of Indian films Ex Machina Welcome to Me Far from the Maddening Crowd The Water Diviner and The Age of Adaline While We Were Young Every Secret Thing and It Follows  So I may be biased against this notion based on where I live
2015-05-19 23:47:34,1,0,1,Home,I didnt find much wrong with it but nothing to write home about either As a huge fan of Eva Green I thought her character was very interesting without spoiling much
2015-05-19 23:54:39,2,0,2,Home,I think Furiosa is pretty close Also its important to note that while we shouldnt need only supermodels doing all this kickass stuff its not like only homely chicks can do that stuff either
2015-05-20 00:08:40,14,0,14,Home,They set up a trap of a naked woman to entice men to try and help her enabling these survivalists to kill and loot whomever came to help I think youre the one that missed the point
2015-05-20 00:10:05,1,0,1,Home,I remember watching it in college A friend bought it sight unseen from the store brought it over and we watched it together We both HATED it At the time I thought it was absurdly bad When he left he didnt even take the DVD home with him

2015-05-20 00:17:00,1,0,1,Home,Thats a real truth Studios are not making enough kid and family friendly movies which is why when something like Home comes out it makes a huuuuge hawl at the box office Seriously Hollywood needs to step their game up when it comes to kids movies
2015-05-20 00:24:27,3,0,3,Home,I saw Mad Max and I absolutely loved it Perfect action movie And then I get home and read about it and find out most of the stunts werent even CG Incredible I thought the characters were great and the dialog was good edgy without being contrived
2015-05-20 00:26:01,1,0,1,Home,I think Hollywood has done a fine job with kids movies Were in a second Renaissance Sure Home sucked but we still have a ton of solid movies Princess movies are fantastic again Pixar is still making great movies and Dreamworks hit a home run with How to Train Your Dragon Megamind was also very good but didnt get as much attention Hell even Sony is doing great with Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs Weve hit a lull but it will definitely pick up now that Summer is just around the corner
2015-05-20 01:18:14,-2,0,-2,Home,Yeah after walking out of the threatre I was just in a state of awe When I got home I just lay on my floor and thought about it for a while

2015-05-20 02:21:45,2,0,2,Home,I gotta say something here  That final scene in A History of Violence was one of the most powerful things Ive ever felt in a movie  Im talking about when he came home the very last scene  He comes back to his family so desperate for their acceptance its like hes pleading with them from the very core of his soul with every step as he walks in and approaches the kitchen table  In every millisecond he is begging them for forgiveness  knowing it probably is impossible yet there is nothing else for him to do he has nothing else now
2015-05-20 02:32:03,9,0,9,Home,You implied it was only good if viewed in theaters I watched it at home and still thoroughly enjoyed it
2015-05-20 03:02:51,20,0,20,Home,When I first read about the movie it was billed as the first in a trilogy shot concurrently by some of the film industry media Although now that it hasnt been well received I dont know if well ever see the final two Even the title Jupiter Ascending seems like the first of others Jupiter Eclipsed Jupiter Avenging Once we heard that earth could be harvested according to the rules of good scifi plot you know someone WILL try to harvest it Big evil corporation is just going to let her have the earth I dont think so  I think it was supposed to play out like this Film 1 Meet Jupiter and her ragtag band of allies and enemies Wow space scifi is cool Look at all the costumes and CG Film 2 Redmayne is not dead just injured and really angry Maybe has to accept a new bionic body part  Jupiter defends the earth from harvest with help from intergalactic rebels and the bees The pill that space boyfriend had Jupiter swallow int he first movie is actually a locator beacon that helps the good guys find her when she is lured off somewhere to die at the hands of the evil space siblings At some point a trusted character who you thought was all nice betrays Jupiter Maybe the bee guy  because of his sick daughter But then redeems himself by dying to save Jupiter at the last minute so Jupiter will somehow save his daughter One of the other ruling space siblings dies for real this time A shocked and awed earth populous survived the aliens and Jupiter becomes a bit of a celebrity on her home planet Film 3 Jupiter solves the mystery of who killed her predecessor and why and somehow uses sick daughter of bee guy to take down the rest of the ruling family using her space virus Or imploding a sun at their home world and then cures the daughter and the afflicted populous of the galaxy Aha the sickness was manufactured on purpose to keep the universe buying the family corporations product but Space Mama had a change of heart so her daughter killed her to stay rich Jupiter become benevolent empress of the universe while resolving the other characters side issues PS hybrid sky skates boyfriend is also secretly some kind of other space royalty despite of his spliced nature Jupiter helps liberate his people and the spliced underclass elevating them to the status of real people They might unsplice sky skates boyfriend beauty and the beast style for a happy ending or maybe just leave him as he is Earth is not alone anymore and the aliens are now all cool and groovy and Space boyfriend wants to show Jupiter the rest of the universe They sail off into the cosmic sunset The End

2015-05-20 03:19:24,2,0,2,Home,I watched it by myself at home and I just had to tell someone else who saw it what I thought to begin OPs video was on point hilariously but seriously really I of course like so many others was disappointed but not by the CGI or even the story itself except for really these two things Channing Tatum and that if it were more rated R so to speak

2015-05-20 09:18:18,2,0,2,Home,When I was 10 or so coming across a mom and pop VHS rental place in my neighborhood that was closing their store since it was their last day they had already tried to sell everything off so they gave me and my sister two 3 ft square boxes full of VHS movies we wheeled them home on a skateboard and would spend the next year or two watching them it was a random assortment of movies and so I came to love all sorts of movies

2015-05-20 14:20:47,3,0,3,Home,The movie was okay but I agree with you on those points They painted him as a hero In real life he was an asshole He was an amazing soldier and Im thankful we had him and people like that in war but he was not a good person He was racist hed rather fight than be at home with his wifechild the movie left out the parts where he bragged about killing people and how he claims he kicked Jesse Venturas ass which was proven to be a lie
2015-05-20 14:38:39,1,0,1,Home,But then he went back to his home country after spending time He was indeed an immigrant and thats all theres to it I wish youd put in as much effort to claim other non white immigrants as Australians even after staying there their whole life but I digress

2015-05-20 15:55:56,1,0,1,Home,Yeah there are a few really creepy moments a time travel movie can drive home Suppose a character is very intelligent and entirely selfinterested and of course the audience can somehow connect to him for his tribulations to be meaningful and something goes wrong and he ends up pitted against himself in all his selfinterest Truly terrifying
2015-05-20 16:05:10,66,0,66,Home,What would this movie possibly win an Oscar for It was a nice scifi but it sure as hell wasnt a home run

2015-05-22 11:51:01,3,0,3,Home,Just saw it yesterday for the first of many times Im sure Crazy good My take on Furiosas backstory which really was just what I was interpreting while watching the movie was that she was at one time when she was young one of Joes wives taken from her people from the east and when she became too old maybe trained and moved up the ranks Also maybe one of her specialty tasks for Joe was wife hunting basically what was done to her and in return her redemption would be for taking girls from their home for Joe Again just my take on it

2015-05-25 16:37:23,2,0,2,Home,Well I dont know if Id call you cynical if you couldnt connect I doubt theres much anyone can convince you otherwise I could only give my own reasons why I think its a masterpiece First I think the criticism of hollow plot is flat out wrong Just because a film has a fairly simple setup and little dialogue it doesnt mean theres nothing to it Fury Road is one of the best examples in recent memory of visual storytelling No information is given through exposition and is instead given through visual cues context and character actions So lets look at the scene you mentioned Furiosa is a character taken as a child from her homeland and forced to work for Immortan Joe Over the years she managed to work her way up the system to the point of being one of his best and most trusted However Furiosa decides to take an opportunity to hurt him where it counts by taking away the Wives who are meant to provide him his heir She wants to do one good thing for all the years of doing God knows what under his command that is her search for redemption And for her that was taking the Wives to the Green Place So when she finally meets with the Many Mothers and realizes that her homeland is no more and the Many Mothers are only a few it destroys her Thats 20 years gone down the drain I found it absolutely heartbreaking Theres more I could talk about but I hope you at least get an idea of why I think the film is great
2015-05-25 16:53:48,7,0,7,Home,I havent watched it since it came out but I remember Thir13een Ghostshttpwwwimdbcomtitlett0245674ref_fn_al_tt_1 ending with all the ghosts going home That was stupid as fuck
2015-05-25 17:05:43,3,0,3,Home,the movie is actually a little above expectations for the studios I Think this is primarily going to be a breakthrough with home video
2015-05-25 17:13:16,21,0,21,Home,I have to disagree The characters are all portrayed with superhuman strength and the typical booming and whooshing effects that accompanied every punch just drove the point home The comic intentionally lacks onomatopoeia as an indictment of the superhero genre its glorification of violence and the tendency to resolve all conflicts with violence It seems like that point flew right over Snyders head
2015-05-25 17:34:22,1,0,1,Home,I think youre not giving enough it enough credit Its not just an ad that says that the film was 1 That information is then used in negotiations between distribution and theaters as they negotiate the splits for the following weeks Look at how often a movie will run a commercial that says 1 Comedy in America even though the weekend box office puts that movie fourth or fifth A huge part of marketing is Your friends have seen it Dont miss out and the 1 draws eyeballs By virtue of the movie finishing first in its opening weekend more theaters are likely to show it on more screens More articles are written about the movie since its top of mind More people are aware of the movie going into the second and third weekend Studios can start planning budgets for the inhome release On and on and on
2015-05-25 18:06:19,1,0,1,Home,Yes amazing in imax At homeyawn
2015-05-25 18:14:59,1,0,1,Home,Not only that but their other example apocalypse now which was based on heart of darkness was about how war consumes you Deer hunter was essentially about how war destroys you and leaves you an empty shell No one not even those that stayed at home were positively effected by what those guys went through Almost everything based on the Vietnam war had the same message war is hell and it will never be won
2015-05-25 18:48:13,7,0,7,Home,T1 stands alone as a great movie partially because of how deep it is thanks to the time travel plot The cut footage really drove that point home Its also quite suspenseful which I felt was somewhat lacking in T2 Plus you really get a sense that the T800 is absolutely unstoppable with how much it pursues them
2015-05-25 19:23:14,2,0,2,Home,Id love to see Spawn as a horrormystery film in the vein of Zodiac Make it about cops investigating brutal backalley dismemberments that lead to unraveling a government conspiracy thats way over their heads I remember reading an article a few years ago about the shared mythology of homelessfoster care children in Florida and it was this twisted mix of urban legend and catholic iconography He could work really well in that space
2015-05-25 19:34:35,2,0,2,Home,But how much of a impact does home video have nowadays

2015-05-25 20:55:41,2,0,2,Home,Its not a great movie but I really enjoyed The Lifeguardhttpwwwrottentomatoescommthe_lifeguard with Kristen Bell which is sitting at a solid 13  I thought it captured the whole midlate20s directionless scared to move on in life just wanna curl up in your childhood bed and go back in time 10 years moving back home thing pretty well  On top of that the chemistry although it should technically be reprehensible between Kristen Bell and David Lambert is pretty strong and interesting to watch  Maybe I enjoyed it so much because it turned out to be much much better than the score would indicate but I would definitely watch it again
2015-05-25 21:01:44,2,0,2,Home,Seriously Its like hes stranded at a bus stop in the Ozarks instead of a million miles away with possibly no chance of ever coming back home Theres no sense of doom or threat

2015-05-25 23:14:01,1,0,1,Home,First this movie was pretty bad in the end so its not a good representation at all It was fairly fun in the beginning disliked the interruptions in the beginning though but then it dived halfway through and the end was ridiculous Second as going to the movie is getting more and more expensive it just not worthwhile paying to watch something you can easily enjoy watching at home on your own large screen tv The way I see it the only exception is if you need to watch it on special 3D screens to fully enjoy the movie Most of these sort of movies are big superheroremakesetctype movies Theatres are shooting themselves in the foot by making it more and more expensive to go watch movies at the cinemas
2015-05-25 23:23:31,0,0,0,Home,It would go both ways and actors would hold franchises hostage Sigourney Weaver got a million dollar payday for Aliens but only after Cameron insisted the film would bomb without her and now that they needed her she didnt need the project and took home a fat paycheck
2015-05-25 23:52:54,5,0,5,Home,Are you serious  The original handled mood and atmosphere far better than Ajas version which went for straight gross out garbage with the deformities and how graphically people died  I found the original hillbilly cannibals more unnerving because they looked like regular people who had been living off the grid for a while  It hit me closer to home and made it harder for me to write it off as movie nonsense

2015-05-26 09:10:24,3,0,3,Home,The Purge Anarchy is the best action film that no one knows about  The original was essential a bad R rated Home Alone  Interesting concept but Mcauly Culkin would have done a better job of defending the house  The Purge Anarchy took that great concept and ran with it  Too bad it didnt have the star power the first one did or it would have been a smash hit

2015-05-26 13:28:45,19,0,19,Home,I dont know if the comparison is solid Casinos poker game must have been ridiculous irl but it was a kinda interesting and totally Bond way to drive a climax Having the head of one of the worlds largest spy agencies decide to abandon all her resources to hide out in a cabin in the middle of no where followed up by a Home Aloneesque last stand battle is not just confusing but not really in line with either old or new Bond styles or particularly novel as an action movie concept Very disappointing imo

2015-05-26 21:37:53,-3,0,-3,Home,Im not a CGI hater My opinion on CGI is that it should be a last resort in meaning that if practical effects are not possible or get the job done then by all means use CGI as an option However this has limits I look at the original Jurrasic park as a good example Lots of practical effects along with CGI when it was called for I find even today this movie holds up and as far as CGI goes still looks good I find today that CGI is too quickly the go to in terms of effects Look at the new mad Max that movie could have been done all CGI however majority of it was practical effects To me with practical effects I can feel the action more and be right into the scenesetting CGI now takes me out of the film and feels so cartoonist and fake Take the new jurrasic world or I dunnothe new poltergeist remake Horror movies do not need CGI and I feel that less is more when it cones to horror I feel like this principal is lost now in modern films a lot So thats why I say CGI as a last resortnot no CGI just a last resort and in moderation Much like Nolan Im also not a fan of 3d films however I find animation is a good home for it
2015-05-26 21:47:36,2,0,2,Home,Enders Game  The movie while retaining the fact that Ender was controlling the actual fleet and not a simulation didnt really explore the idea that the fleet had been en route to the enemy home world for YEARS and YEARS in the hopes that by time they got there a suitable commander would be in a position to direct them  This took away a little bit that the humans were on an offensive that had been in the works for a very long time

2015-05-27 08:49:41,0,0,0,Home,This going to sound trollish but I swear its not The amount of thought and selling one does as a filmmaker doesnt end when you say cut It continues when you go and promote the film and do interviews where you hammer home talking points about how I like to do it all in camera and not use CGI which is then picked up and repeated endlessly by a thousand film sites which are nothing more than glorifies copy and pastes of the talking points
2015-05-27 11:46:23,1,0,1,Home,Its worth seeing  If you go see it in theater try to make it to a cheaper showing  The mivies isnt worth a full price ticket but if you get a discount ticket and skip the concessions its money well spent   If you cant find the time to see it in theater dont kick yourself the movie doesnt rely heavily on the visuals hit up a red box and watch it at home

2015-05-27 14:18:09,1,0,1,Home,Honest question How on earth is it a bad thing to have unions in the film industry To me it appears that unions are only reasons several of my friends who are film professionals have health insurance and good wages For example a close friend of mine is a grip lighting and electricition He wouldnt be able to take care of his two children wife and family member fighting leukemia in the samesimilar position in a different industry concert or home lighting Union wages and fair treatment rules are literally saving his family I can only see the positive Also they are the ONLY reason that when he works overtime or when they make him miss a meal he gets paid OT The accountants reporting 200 hours with no OT on this thread would kill for that

2015-05-27 15:59:50,0,0,0,Home,So my argument is invalid because of conditions you invented Well I think you only like it because you saw it in space while riding a dolphin No one was more excited for that movie than me I made everyone I know read the book in preparation Even my mom I listened to the soundtrack every day I bought that issue of Empire magazine and read it over and over again just imagining how great this was going to be And then I got an overtextured glowing futuristic mess The problems with the film outside of the fact that absolutely nothing is left to the viewer to figure out because its spoon fed to you like pea and carrot paste down a babys throat have nothing really to do with the script It is the way everything is presented Its one of the most misdirected films Ive ever seen Gone are the sobering brown and grey tones in favor of more eye catching primary colors So to do we trade unflattering silver age costumes for the fetish gear average viewers expect from a forgettable popcorn romp Any scene that relies on subtlety is played down or abandoned completely in favor for more sizzling 3D friendly action rendering the motivations of our characters somewhere between befuddling and utterly nonsensical Looking back on that Empire article I shouldve known better Snyder describes Watchmen as something he didnt believe he was supposed to have  A dirty little secret Just one more hollywood figure who thinks grim and violent are synonyms for serious He clearly believes that what makes Watchmen an adult story is sex but what makes Watchmen an honest adult story is that the characters talk about it afterwards These are the moments that get cut down to make more room for Silk Spectre spinning through fire in slow motion Even scenes that are violent but in a way that is supposed to make us uncomfortable like Rorschach with the dogs are minimized or replaced with uncomplicated glorified American movie violence But even with all that said I still bought the Ultimate Cut when it came out My first bluray Trying to make sense of the mess Trying to prove to myself that I hadnt been so misled The Ultimate Cut is a noticeably more interesting film mostly for the inclusion of more material dealing with Nixon and the doomsday clock But its still just four hours of hyperstylized easily digested crap It belongs with movies like Fast and the Furious and Expendables when it should be at home with Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy and Argo
2015-05-27 16:00:20,2,0,2,Home,1 It seemed to me that the instability in Cuba was less of a concern for Michael than whether he can trust Roth He may have speculated that the Cuban rebels could win but he was definitely not sure if Roth was somebody he could continue to do business with Roth orchestrated the assassination attempt on Michaels home and he backed The Rosato Brothers in NYC I think Michael went along with Roth for a period as part of his keep your friends close and your enemies closer mantra It wasnt until Roths plan was clear attempting to assassinate Pentangeli and getting him to cooperate with the Feds that Michael decided to hit back at Roth

2015-05-29 01:35:37,-5,0,-5,Home,Its a sweet blend of everythings 80s  A nice throwback that engulfs you in that world  It has the technology the music the style the cheekiness It has overthetop action and plot that doesnt really make alot of sense but that was the 80s Dialogue and fight scenes that are cheesy but still awesome And the right colors and effects to take it home

2015-05-29 02:35:37,5,0,5,Home,Admissions have fallen down steadly for decades as prices have gone up Also films used to have multiple reissues in theaters and had plenty of rereleases before TV and Home video
2015-05-29 02:39:05,2,0,2,Home,The game about the spinning tops Im very curious what they could put on a screen that couldnt be emulated at home  but of course one of the beyblades is going to have an evil spirit or something

2015-05-29 05:12:06,1,0,1,Home,I had trouble liking this movie knowing some of the shady things Chris Kyle had claimed after he came homethe whole Superdome thing and Jessie Ventura garbage  The move was ok but I agree definitely not as good as I thought as it would be
2015-05-29 06:01:43,3,0,3,Home,Youre remarkably quick to back away from your point  South Park is satire and has always been satire  Parker and Stone are much more inclined to make a joke than they are to play something straight  Its a fucking comedy show  Theyre fucking comedians  They want to make people laugh not preach their worldview everywhere  But more to the point South Park and Team America are different things  Just because South Park plays it straight once in a while doesnt mean Team America is automatically serious  Its obviously a satire which is the real issue  Homeboy seems to think that it was actually proIraq war and shit  To anyone with half a brain the message is clearly none of these assholes know what theyre doing  Team America thinks they are the shit and does nothing but fuck things up FAG thinks they are the shit and does nothing but fuck things up theyre all a bunch of idiots  When Americans try to intervene in world affairs they only make things worse
2015-05-29 06:40:35,1,0,1,Home,I think Prometheus was kinda sorta inferring that the aliensxenomorphs were the result of a rapid mutational bioweapon of sorts If so they may not necessarily have a specific home world However they certainly could overwhelm a planet at make it their own

2015-05-29 15:07:53,11,0,11,Home,This reminds me I was watching the Simpsons the other day on FX and it was the episode where they go rafting with the boy scouts and Homer has the bright idea to take the wrong fork in the river and they get lost at sea There are a few cuts back to the main group of scouts and the scout leader and there is a scene where theyre in a bayou looking swamp area and the banjo starts playing like in Deliverance and a red necks silhouette can be seen creeping along the shoreI was actually amazed at how dark that joke was esp for The Simpsons
2015-05-29 15:33:25,8,0,8,Home,I felt like the first 95 of the movie was very enjoyable The last 5 of the movie couldnt have been hammered home any harder if they wrote Be better on a hammer and just hit you in the face with it
2015-05-29 15:40:55,9,0,9,Home,I am a big fan of Lindelof but I believe he is more suited for television People shit on him for LOST but I thought he was a great writer for the show Also his work on The Leftovers is phenomenal A lot of people dislike Leftovers for being extremely bleak and believe me it is Its a bleak fucking show but goddamn is it enthralling and kept me coming back for more punishment each week Lindelof is at home when he is able to tell stories in a longer format but I encourage him to continue to work with film so that he can improve and bring the same quality of entertainment to film as he does with television
2015-05-29 15:42:30,1,0,1,Home,As far as The Bling Ring its a mixed bag amp personally I wouldnt associate it with strong female cast although Im not sure if the question is looking for strong acting andor toughresilient characters my take is the latter but The Bling Ring doesnt have either for me  A group of vapid celebrityobsessed girls track amp rob celebrities homes I didnt read anything interesting in it  Sofia Coppola has done some fantastic movies but I found this one disappointing
2015-05-29 15:50:24,1,0,1,Home,What they should do is offer to purchase the movie digitally after youve seen it on your way out of the theater Put a redemption code on your ticket that can only be accessed after the date you see it That way the people who really like it can take a copy home and youre not cutting into ticket sales  the people who really want to see it again in the theater will do so regardless This wouldnt eliminate piracy completely but it would remove a HUGE incentive to pirate movies  if I knew I was going to get an HD copy after I see the movie I would have no reason to
2015-05-29 16:01:24,2,0,2,Home,Support more Homer scripts

2015-05-29 17:02:54,1,0,1,Home,The first scenes of the movie make clear that they are tying up the loose ends left by the Chitauri incident Once they retrieve the scepter Cap says something like That should take care of HYDRA and the Chitauri Meaning theres no need for the Avengers anymore Then they go home and have a big party or revels expecting to go off and do their own thing after
2015-05-29 17:16:38,2,0,2,Home,now Navy SEALs with Charlie Sheen id watch that classic action movie any day Its pro American military but also shows how shady they are  it has the best golf montage EVER and was filmed in my home town
2015-05-29 17:35:03,1,0,1,Home,Presuming Id missed it at the cinema I watched a 1080p copy of it at home months before it got released here Id actually have taken the time to go to see it at the cinema which isnt true of most films but there was no point by the time it was released to my surprise
2015-05-29 17:37:13,1,0,1,Home,This is why I went to see Ex Machina in the theater despite it being one of those movies where I wouldnt miss much by watching it at home The idea looked interesting and I wanted to support it
2015-05-29 17:48:25,0,0,0,Home,Actually from what I understand its becoming quite regular and successful since the market is growing Perhaps people simply want to go to the theater since not everyone might not have the same amount of room for a home theater experience like in the US
2015-05-29 18:33:00,1,0,1,Home,Its funny when they showed the picnic in the family home movies and you see Brad Dourif in the background I was thoroughly convinced it was a different actor just because I didnt want to believe they would even attempt to pass off Brad Dourif as his young self from almost 20 years Then the later flashbacks show him up close and I realized they certainly did try

2015-05-29 21:19:08,1,0,1,Home,I completely support independent production Im so freaking tired of sequels prequels threequels remakes spin offs TV SHOWS BASED ON MOVIES Hollywood is completely out of touch with creativity and its maddening independent directors are our not our only hope but they might as well be BC Tarantino isnt gonna put out a movie every 3 months the only reason Im so adamant about original content is because none of these remakesspin offs are any good at all they vomit out the same damn movie over amp over never adding any originality to them its very frustrating as a cinephile I dont understand how everyone is so nonchalant about it  this is why movies suck now and yes they do suck last year was KIND of a good year for movies but all in all superheroes found footage home invasions and cliche action flix are all were gonna get
2015-05-29 21:20:04,2,0,2,Home,It actually became my favorite film after I saw it mainly because I really hits home for me My parents are educators my older sister works with autistic children my best friend basically raised her 3 younger sisters and I tried my hand at teaching as well Helping struggling kids has been a part of my life for as long as I can remember
2015-05-29 21:22:48,3,0,3,Home,The problem is its more fun when the characters arent bumbling idiots that get extremely lucky constantly We like the characters and want them to be good at what they do not roll in like a bull in a china shop and come out unscathed because the plot conveniently lets them wake up after they should be dead Its like making a baseball movie where the main character hits a game winning bunt that the wind miraculously carries over the fence for a home run
2015-05-29 21:28:14,2,0,2,Home,I have been pessimistic about Star Trek 3 ever since JJ left The writing in those movies hasnt been stellar but JJ was always able to turn them into enjoyable films with a lot of fun energy I enjoyed the first one and thought the second was a lot more flawed but still had that fun energy I probably wont even bother to see this one in the theatre and wait for home media
2015-05-29 21:30:10,16,0,16,Home,You mean Live Die Repeat Kinda hard to get a following when marketing completely changes the name of the movie between theatrical release and home release

2015-05-29 22:05:21,2,0,2,Home,I worked at a residential home and my experience was nearly identical to how this movie portrayed one Its crazy how accurate it is It felt like I was watching a movie about myself working at a home
2015-05-29 22:21:05,1,0,1,Home,I think alot of that has to do with the accesibility of movies at home  A movie has to be the biggest best etc to be worth the time money and hassle to go to a theater  Otherwise just wait a bit and you can catch it at home  Mad Max you mention is one that would be a shame to miss in the theater since some of the best and original things about it are its bigness and craziness
2015-05-30 00:22:40,1,0,1,Home,Thats one writers opinion hardly fact To think hes more influential than Homer or Dante is pretty ridiculous To think that someone within the last 100 or so years has had more of an influence on literature which has been around for thousands of years is ridiculous He didnt have any influence on Hugo Dickens Twain Wilde and thats only within the last 150 or so years Explain his influence on the thousands of years of literature that existed before he was born You can make the argument he has done so for contemporary literature but ever No Thats like saying Kanye is more influential than Bach except imagine Bach existed thousands of years beforehand
2015-05-30 00:25:17,11,0,11,Home,Just a reminder that the US home video release emphasised the tagline but did not retitle the film I know its futile to say this
2015-05-30 00:47:52,1,0,1,Home,they changed the title for the home media release
2015-05-30 01:29:35,4,0,4,Home,Wow  While the VFX are indeed impressive this just hammers home how much was accomplished in camera for reals

2015-05-30 03:53:16,2,0,2,Home,25 fps in Europe and no one used 18 fps to save money unless they wanted the entire film to be in fast motion 18 fps was a speed used by home movie cameras and projectors
2015-05-30 03:53:50,2,0,2,Home,You know whats a really good way to support original films Support independent theaters I just moved to an area with one and I have seen so many films there that I wouldnt get a chance to otherwise and every time I go I get excited about coming back to see more films like While Were Young A Girl Walks Home Alone at Night What We Do in the Shadows and classic films like Mad Max and Goodfellas
2015-05-30 04:37:13,4,0,4,Home,I went to the theater and chose to see This is 40 rather than Django Unchained and I now realize I wasted my money Django was awesome at home but in the theater I would have had a much more memorable experience compared to almost any comedy

2015-05-30 10:29:04,1,0,1,Home,I saw Tomorrowland The movie was meh I would certainly never pay to watch it at home and I suggest you never either watching it for free when it comes on cable is the only way you should watch it You go into the movie thinking that its a kid movie and for the most part it is but then they start actually killing like 3 people no main characters
2015-05-30 10:55:40,1,0,1,Home,Yeah Sean Penn and lets give credit to Michael J Fox as well was great and I love de Palma I guess it didnt necessarily come together for me and hit home like the others I mentioned did
2015-05-30 11:47:04,1,0,1,Home,Which makes Gone with the Winds numbers even more amazing No overseas market money No home media for a significant amount of time after release No product placement ad money No action toy tieins Fewer theaters Lower population
2015-05-30 15:25:52,15,0,15,Home,Great news However Ive noticed many rmovies users prefer movies post1990s These silent pics are a treasure The only downside is that costly restorations doesnt always lead to affordable home video We shall see
2015-05-30 15:33:52,1,0,1,Home,All my friends always react the same way when i say i havent watched it They are always like how has this happened and go home and watch it now It has been on my list for awhile Time to just do it

2015-05-30 18:10:30,1,0,1,Home,But thats my point That premise is almost certainly been taken well out of context by whomever wrote it on the web Therefore reading anything into it or putting weight behind it is pointless

2015-05-30 19:08:54,12,0,12,Home,This was also the difference between competing with films like Con Air Men in Black and The Lost World and then being released when you had films like Scream 2 Mousehunt Home Alone 3 and Mr Magoo in the theaters
2015-05-30 19:15:17,5,0,5,Home,Was that on the original posters or just the home video

2015-05-30 19:29:02,34,0,34,Home,Umm there were plenty of things to do back then But thats not the point Gone with the Wind came out when there was no home video no TV So the only time you would ever be able to see it would be in a theater This caused many many repeat viewings for the general public They wanted to see it as many times before it went away forever
2015-05-30 20:24:50,7,0,7,Home,Agreed  Lilo and Stitch still keeps a subversive edge and is unique among Disney animated films but this scene drives home some points that are only hinted at elsewhere and the humor is dead on  Love it

2015-05-31 16:02:28,22,0,22,Home,I agree with you 100 based off the trailer alone but I think you might be comparing apples to oranges is all Im saying  Notorious was more of a biography Straight Outta Compton seems like it will have a much larger scope  For what it was worth I still really liked the story of Biggie and I remember being at home after seeing Notoroious combing youtube for sick Biggie freestyles theres plenty

2015-05-31 19:09:11,1,0,1,Home,I think the Back to the Future opening is underrated We see a home with clever machinery that doesnt work well which describes docs character a man with ideas but he isnt successful yet Then we see someone come in crank up all the equipment to high and we see his guitar and a fucking huge amplifier which implies that this guy dreams of being big and has a big ego The moment he strums his guitar the amp explodes sending Marty flying back into a shelf This shows that his big ego often gets him into trouble We know everything we need to know about this character without any dialogue Genius

2015-05-01 05:49:52,2,0,2,Roar,My theatre roared with laughter when Cap moved the hammer and Thor squirmed
2015-05-01 19:22:15,1,0,1,Roar,To me it seemed like hulk was used mainly to roar when they needed a badass moment to stick
2015-05-02 04:01:20,-7,0,-7,Roar,Maybe I am too ignorant and dont fully get the offensive joke but I feel like I have heard way more offensive lines followed by roars of laughter I cant tell if people truly find this inexcusable or if they have biased opinions towards it because Adam has made several shit films recently

2015-05-02 17:38:25,1,0,1,Roar,Sandler reached that point and roared past it with his eyes shut astride a rocket painted with racial slurs
2015-05-03 14:50:48,9,0,9,Roar,Lol it roared like a trex  I busted out laughing
2015-05-04 01:00:57,1,0,1,Roar,ROAR
2015-05-04 08:03:31,1,0,1,Roar,Surprised fans arent in uproar Even to someone who doesnt know the character the patch thingy is obviously on the wrong eye
2015-05-04 11:50:37,1,0,1,Roar,Not always the best way to watch  The roar of the audience can overwhelm some choice  one liners    I had to see avengers a third time to hear the puny god  line from the hulk
2015-05-04 14:41:31,0,0,0,Roar,Im pretty sure they even used Godzillas famous roar in the first trailer as a BWAAAAAM effect
2015-05-04 15:07:28,2,0,2,Roar,Jodorowsky and Lynch represent an entirely different kind of bizarre  That said I agree that Roar is quite the wild ride  Simultaneously hilarious and horrifying its funny to see the actors get interrupted by lions but its depressing to think how many of them actually were injured on set  I think my favorite pet had to be with the woman in the barrel being thrown around by the elephant which was absolutely bonkers  Great great film hope to pick it up on BluRay in the future when its released
2015-05-04 22:40:57,148,0,148,Roar,Movie opens the Gang are doing another bank hiest Screaming of Civs the roaring of hiesters advising them to eat dat dirt and guards cuffing themselves voluntary

2015-05-05 02:59:43,2,0,2,Roar,gt In the meantime HawkeyeVisionHulk theyre not getting any standalone flicks any time soon either wheres the uproar for that
2015-05-05 16:16:22,1,0,1,Roar,I would agree with that Having a fan base in an uproar is never a good idea I just didnt think that Disney was making these with comics readers in mind as their main audience
2015-05-05 21:37:15,10,0,10,Roar,Its not new Look at the whole bigger than Jesus quote by The Beatles that had people in an uproar
2015-05-05 22:20:29,1,0,1,Roar,Ive heard an opera singer perform this song in a club  She brought the crowd to their feet roaring approval
2015-05-06 04:28:55,8,0,8,Roar,Theres nothing wrong with these but when are they going to do more wheel of the worst These are entertaining but those are uproarious

2015-05-08 02:35:57,8,0,8,Roar,The biggest scene in the trilogy was the part in Return of the Jedi when Luke does that reverse jump off the skiff and R2 tosses him the light saber  That was the most uproarious movie experience Ive ever experienced
2015-05-08 22:24:40,2,0,2,Roar,Two Face in The Dark Knight would have scared me much more than that when I was a kid Well to be fair when I was a kid I would have rated Jurassic Park NC17 for the TRex roar alone because that gave me nightmares for months
2015-05-09 20:22:52,14,0,14,Roar,My life fades The vision dims All that remains are memories I remember a time of chaos ruined dreams this wasted land But most of all I remember The Road Warrior The man we called Max To understand who he was you have to go back to another time when the world was powered by the black fuel and the desert sprouted great cities of pipe and steel Gone now swept away For reasons long forgotten two mighty warrior tribes went to war and touched off a blaze which engulfed them all Without fuel they were nothing Theyd built a house of straw The thundering machines sputtered and stopped Their leaders talked and talked and talked But nothing could stem the avalanche Their world crumbled The cities exploded A whirlwind of looting a firestorm of fear Men began to feed on men On the roads it was a white line nightmare Only those mobile enough to scavenge brutal enough to pillage would survive The gangs took over the highways ready to wage war for a tank of juice And in this maelstrom of decay ordinary men were battered and smashed men like Max the warrior Max In the roar of an engine he lost everything and became a shell of a man a burntout desolate man a man haunted by the demons of his past a man who wandered out into the wasteland And it was here in this blighted place that he learned to live again
2015-05-09 23:05:30,6,0,6,Roar,Yeah Hans Zimmer is the bomb at sound experimentation For Man of Steel he just got loads of thin articulate metal in different shapes and slid other pieces of metal across it in different fashion to create amazing drone sounds and metallic roars
2015-05-10 00:08:46,27,0,27,Roar,Do the roar
2015-05-10 17:36:20,3,0,3,Roar,ROAR This was the best example of insanity put on film Ive seen in a long while All the stunts were real and there were no special effects this movie really has 100 giant cats terrorizing a family I dont know what they were trying to make it was part horror movie part Family movie part Bmovie with interjected political messages throughout I was constantly laughing and wincing at the same time It was amazing
2015-05-11 01:36:26,1,0,1,Roar,I saw ROAR last Saturday and loved it so much that I saw it again on Monday night  And I loved it so much the second time that I ordered the DVD
2015-05-11 06:31:55,3,0,3,Roar,Animatronics Do you realize how underwhelming that would be when you have a god of thunder and a man who can fly in a metal suit and a gigantic green monster Yes the Marvel Comics are about messed up individuals who deal with human flaws and issues but theyre only in those situations because the powers that they have access to An animatronic Hulk is going to be good for pivoting and roaring Doesnt really quite get his power for destruction right Neither will an animatronic iron man get Starks flair for the dramatic and thus his vanity
2015-05-12 13:50:41,1,0,1,Roar,Seen 2001 a few months ago in Glasgow and there was some applause but not really an uproarious applause from back to front If ever there was a film for it I guess
2015-05-12 14:29:33,9,0,9,Roar,I mentioned this before the the whole Luke escapes the Sarlacc scene with the flip and somersault while grabbing his new lightsaber that R2 launched in the air was the most uproarious movie going experience that Ive experienced
2015-05-12 15:22:14,71,0,71,Roar,It would be funny if it was a typical Godzilla roarhttpyoutubeORSvf8eVa0g just in a whispered tone
2015-05-12 16:14:12,1,0,1,Roar,I had a great crowd when I went to see Guardians of the Galaxy People were laughing uproariously and clearly just having a great time throughout the entire movie People clapped at the end and at the part where the blue guy killed all those guys with his whistlearrow thing I thought it was a little weird that they clapped at that part but whatever
2015-05-12 17:03:26,1,0,1,Roar,Days of Thunder  an uproar of applause in the last few moments Small town in the south US

2015-05-13 12:42:01,1,0,1,Roar,I was not expecting the direction this article took  I was thinking it would list movies like Roar or the Twilight Zone movie
2015-05-13 13:03:04,2,0,2,Roar,When I saw Furious 7 after the tribute there was a roar of applause before the screen even went black to end
2015-05-13 18:23:04,-2,0,-2,Roar,Its not that you make a bad point I think if it was paced well and maybe only an hour and 2030 minutes long then it might be great Off the top of my head lets say that theres like a 5 minute opening of whoever the scientificmedical team going through a cargo room of different captured animals some alien a couple from earth Then lets say they pick Rocket because of his handspaws plus hes small maybe the tech is expensive so its cheaper So 5 movie minutes in they start the painful building process another 15 to 25 minutes later he finally talks before that he learns how to walk up right painful surgeries Another 15 movie minutes later hes talking like normal hes learning fast Hes wanting to do his own thing but hes meeting resistance hes remembering the pain maybe even remembering the people talking down about him smelly creature freak whatever the insults So 20 minutes of him finding out hes nothing but a experiment these 2 scientists who act like his friends and loved him were only doing it as an assignment to keep him in check if he became hostel So 65 movie minutes in and he realizes no one cares about his well being not even the two human like beings So maybe a failed escape attempt then him planning for a his final escape because theyre tired of dealing with his defiance theyre going to turn him into a cooperative experiment by damaging the part of his brain that controls freewill So now 75 minutes in we get the 15 to 20 minute escape sneaking fighting leaving a path of destruction as he gains his freedom Then maybe the last minute as hes flying off to freedom he hears a roar autopilot enabled he goes in the spacecrafts cargohold and finds Groot in a glassmetal cage Credits roll Im trying to just give a basic idea that its not all talking that there is a journey some humor but lots of heartache and rebellion
2015-05-14 14:51:08,2,0,2,Roar,People in my theatre were rip roaring laughing at every clever line of dialog snoring and discussing plot points throughout the film Such is seeing movies in NYC
2015-05-14 20:31:22,1,0,1,Roar,Just a bit Opening day in a completely empty screening The only noise was the roar of engines the savage thunder of war drums and my heart pounding with them
2015-05-14 22:35:20,2,0,2,Roar,I came here to say Jurassic Park TRex roar Also worth nothing is pretty much every other dinosaur sound in the Jurassic Park movies are great
2015-05-15 04:11:04,1,0,1,Roar,The way the engines roar into action as fire spits out of them and the electric flaming guitar chugs faster and more aggressiveIt puts a smile on your face as you know shits about to go downThat smile barely left me the whole movie
2015-05-15 20:18:55,6,0,6,Roar,I kinda wish they didnt show the PoleCats in the trailer As the movie roared along to the point when they arrive near the greenplace I kept having this thought in the back of my mind that they are still in deep trouble because they havent started the cirque du soleil part yet
2015-05-16 00:43:28,0,0,0,Roar,Youve never been dead huh You just fill in the parts most of it is just a blur and the roar of the ocean like listening to a giant seashell You focus on such small things they turn into creations as delicate deep and meaningful as the cosmos
2015-05-16 02:54:00,1,0,1,Roar,Theres no swearing front and center no  there may one use but its drowned out by engine roar i think its early on when hes strapped to the front of the nuxmobile
2015-05-16 03:44:58,1,0,1,Roar,It was striking that when the chaos and explosions calmed down the visual colour palette was vivid and searing ie the roaring dust cloud when Furiosas crew catches on that she is escaping the Citadel the haunting blue sky before the war rig towing scene
2015-05-16 17:52:18,57,0,57,Roar,Theres a new 3D version of The Great Gatsby  I saw it  In 3D it was almost like the sober examination of the unrestrained materialism and absent moral center of the roaring 20s jumped right out at you
2015-05-17 00:48:24,4,0,4,Roar,Chicago here All rivalries aside my theater roared at their appearance So funny
2015-05-17 07:02:20,15,0,15,Roar,Youd think that but theres actually three different special edition cuts of the trilogy There was the theatrical special edition from 1997 the DVD cut from 2004 Special edition with some additional changes notably replacing Sebastian Shaw with Hayden Christensen at the end and extending the ending of Return of the Jedi to show more prequel planets making it take for fucking ever in the process and ruining the one special edition change I actually liked Also had some of the CGI redone like replacing the 97 ANH Jabba with the model from TPM and some weird problems with the audio and video messed up colors and sounds being in the wrong channel and the BluRay cut from 2011 which was 2004 edition with even more changes the most infamous probably being Vaderas added No in ROTJ Wicket blinking with creepy CGI eyes R2 hiding behind an extra rock in ANH the best explanation anyone has for that one is it was done in preparation for the aborted 3D rerelease and Obi Wans Krayt Dragon roar being replaced with some guy yelling into a microphone Ironically all of this means that the special edition we all went to see in the theaters in 1997 is itself a nearly lost cut of the movie only existing on VHS tapes laserdiscs and fan preservations based on these
2015-05-17 20:38:48,26,0,26,Roar,Well the projection for its international opening was in the range of 75M80M So I wouldnt exactly call it a roaring start The general movie going audience is not appreciating it as much as WB would have liked I hope it has legs and fan audience watches it multiple times
2015-05-18 10:54:49,84,0,84,Roar,Yeah that roar as the doors are closing and thats the first time they showed Godzilla goosebumps
2015-05-18 16:53:16,2,0,2,Roar,So I just came back from this movie and I watched t in 4DX here in Seoul and I have to say it really added a new demension to it You feel the preasure of the air when bullets fly by right and left of your face they spray a bit of moisture when the caracter you are looking through hisher eyes gets blook on their own face the seats tilt during the helicopter flight of the cammera you again get water blown on you when the character youre looking at falls into water while driving on top of of the cars you get a fresh breeze of wind blown over you and even smoke is released during explosions on the screen when the caracter is hit in their back you get kicked by the chair to a little bit and when the engine roars your chair vibrates as if you where in the vehicle
2015-05-18 18:42:46,1,0,1,Roar,Theres some footage of the event including the Doof Warrior shredding in this articlehttpwwwsmhcomauentertainmentmoviesmadmaxfuryroadv8sroaratthesydneyoperahouse20150513gh0s9ehtml

2015-05-19 05:55:12,28,0,28,Roar,Yeah I saw it recently since I live in California and it airs pretty often you have to wonder who decided that the correct approach was to just ignore everything thats going on and still advertise the whale shows in the ad Sea World does great things for some other sea creatures and has plenty of other attractions the whales are what everyone is in an uproar about Odd move
2015-05-19 06:01:35,18,0,18,Roar,gt the whales are what everyone is in an uproar about
2015-05-20 20:03:38,9,0,9,Roar,In the roar of an engine he lost everything and became a shell of a man a burntout desolate man a man haunted by the demons of his past a man who wandered out into the wasteland And it was here in this blighted place that he learned to live again
2015-05-21 13:12:01,3,0,3,Roar,On the contrary what I am saying is that these women are hypocrites for making an uproar about ageism and sexism but got no problem with getting a role soley based on their looks
2015-05-21 17:15:18,1,0,1,Roar,The lions roars really sell the whole thing
2015-05-22 04:22:43,2,0,2,Roar,I thought the best part was the last paragraph which seems increasingly relevant as fans get more worked up over reviews  but not the content of the review so much as the the issue of whether its favorable or not Remember the uproar over any less than glowing reviews of the Dark Knight Its okay to point out that movies flaws now but at the time it would get you pilloried
2015-05-22 06:20:59,1,0,1,Roar,You mean when it roars and the others fly away I think it just roared and scared them
2015-05-22 07:21:32,21,0,21,Roar,Wasnt there just recently a giant uproar from a certain community because of a rape scene in the popular TV show Game of thrones Now there is seemingly an entire movie dedicated to the rape sadistic torture and murder of a man Something feels off to me
2015-05-22 14:47:12,120,0,120,Roar,Sound editors think theyre funny Its like putting a Wilhelm Scream or a Lion Roar with an explosion funny if youre in on it obnoxious if you know about it
2015-05-22 15:06:21,1,0,1,Roar,Is that the Indominus Rex with the Trex roar Not sure I like that if thats the case The Trex roar should only apply to the trex
2015-05-22 17:24:48,1,0,1,Roar,When have they used a lions roar
2015-05-22 17:31:43,2,0,2,Roar,well i suppose that character changed in the first mad max movie when he lost his wife and kid   in the roar of the engine he lost everythingand became the shell of a man a burned out desolate man a man haunted by the demons of his past a man who wandered out into the wastelandand it was here in this blooded place that he learned to live again from the intro of mad max 2 the road warrior
2015-05-22 23:07:35,1,0,1,Roar,Wouldnt the Indominous Rex have a different sounding roar than the iconic roar of Jurassic Parks Trex It IS a differentnew dino breed Are they using that roar because of the Trex being one of the dinosaur breeds being incorporated into the IRex
2015-05-23 03:57:32,0,0,0,Roar,Sub plot involving Howard Roark
2015-05-23 06:49:50,3,0,3,Roar,I might be misremembering but in the intro to Roar Warrior there is mention of a war between Great Warrior Tribes that I assumed meant nuclear war I had figured that the nukes were fired some time between Mad Max and Road Warrior but that might be my mistake
2015-05-23 21:30:05,79,0,79,Roar,Thats not the bad writing the bad writing is when this preternatural prehistoric killing machine leans in and takes 10 seconds to scary roar at Ian Malcom instead of you know biting him  thus leaving time for the girl to distract it
2015-05-23 21:49:17,1,0,1,Roar,Hmm its a novel idea but one of the biggest joys of Fury Road was hearing the fucking ROAR of the engines as they hauled ass the wasteland
2015-05-23 23:45:25,2,0,2,Roar,I love this stupid trope in movies  particularly modern movies with stupid scary cgi creaturesbeastsmonsters where upon its on screen debut it will take a second to pointedly roar at the main charactersaudience for no fucking reason whatsoever And then usually again as its about to kill the main character before some plot armor intervention that saves the main character I dunno maybe I get too easily riled up at these things
2015-05-24 00:42:40,3,0,3,Roar,That seems like another cherry pick complaint to me You can see similar shit happen in real life when a predator like a tiger or wolf is face to face with a human they dont always just attack right away they will stand their ground and growl roar Its not that unbelievable to me
2015-05-24 01:03:13,0,0,0,Roar,Is the Raptor standing ground Looks like hes at the tail end of a hunt Dont know too many predators that would be in hot pursuit of their prey be moments away from catching them and decide to stop and roar
2015-05-24 02:07:00,2,0,2,Roar,The film was marketed perfectly In fact the marketing was a roaring success I dont know how anyone can say it wasnt marketed well
2015-05-24 10:01:14,0,0,0,Roar,That movie ended for me once the raptors killed off the last hunter in the field Everything till then was alright But everything afterwards Well I remember a boat everyone on the boat being dead Then a Trex roaring on Alcatraz or some shit
2015-05-24 15:50:19,2,0,2,Roar,Watched a Korean film The Admiral roaring currents was entertained Plot  A Korean admiral leads 12 ships to victory against an an invading Japanese fleet numbering 300 vessels Based on a true story has the actor from Oldboy cant remember his name
2015-05-24 17:25:22,1,0,1,Roar,The Omega Man The Sands Of Iwo Jima The Shootist The Roaring Twenties great James Cagney role and Von Ryans Express were the first to come to mind
2015-05-25 04:28:59,4,0,4,Roar,I feel like the movie could have done that without the soundtrack entirely  and with the rumor that a silent version of the film might be released the director might agree The roar of engines crash of wheels and squeal of breaks may have done it alone
2015-05-26 03:09:57,1,0,1,Roar,I dont think it looks good at all But Im sure it will make lots of box office money My theater was roaring with laughter yesterday when a trailer for it played before Tomorrowland
2015-05-26 16:25:30,1,0,1,Roar,I was eh on the guy who played him in Arkham Origins What I like about Conroys Batman so much is the control in his voice That calmness but darkness and rage obviously hidden behind it Even when hes angryscaredworried Kevin Conroys Batman sounds calm Hes in control 100 of the time Meanwhile Arkham Origins Batman was always roaring and growling He sounded like Wolverine Not Batman This is the same problem I had with Christian Bales voice Michael Keaton is the only real life Batman that did Batmans voice well I think
2015-05-26 16:32:21,22,0,22,Roar,Big Eaty Roar Roars that translation intern earned his money that day
2015-05-26 22:24:58,5,0,5,Roar,Im waiting for the uproar when they cast an actor from Bangladesh
2015-05-26 23:00:14,7,0,7,Roar,I still have a soft spot for both the movie and Zilla himself Honestly and were being hypothetical here since it would obviously be compared to Godzilla if it wasnt marketed as a film about the big G it might have done better Zillas no Godzilla hes not a walking apocalypse bent on wrecking everyones shit hes insanely weak and he lacks a breath weapon outside of that sonic boom roar But hes still a really cool kaiju being surprisingly fast and nimble and having an appealing design
2015-05-27 16:40:06,1,0,1,Roar,According to bluraycomhttpwwwbluraycomTheQuietRoar382654Releases it was released in Sweden Norway Denmark and Finland last March
2015-05-27 20:04:30,4,0,4,Roar,Well to be fair Owen was using a raised voice with an aggressive tone and physical display They would understand that they are being scolded for their behavior just from body language and the fact that they are getting yelled at Using dialogue is just better for the viewer than seeing Chris Pratt just roaring back at them

2015-05-29 07:45:21,6,0,6,Roar,Once I see it I gotta wait until TRex roars and the JP banner falls down at the end
2015-05-29 19:18:30,2,0,2,Roar,Theres a movie Drafthouse Films distributed called ROARhttpwwwroarthemoviecom thats playing at one of the theaters in my city this weekend Checking that out as well as Kung Fury
2015-05-29 19:43:23,1,0,1,Roar,Watch Wild Tales it is an uproarious Tarantinoesque romp featuring six unconnected stories of revenge It was nominated for this years Best Foreign Language Film Oscar
2015-05-30 04:21:40,6,0,6,Roar,You know the shot of the TRex first breaking out of its paddock and roaring in Jurassic Park Yeah that shot perfectly shows the wonder fear and fun that Jurassic Park causes
2015-05-01 01:12:24,46,0,46,Focus,Man I dont know what all of you people are complaining about The fights in the first three were amazing The whole point of the Jedi fights is that its a battle of Wills and their connection with the Force They can feel and anticipate each others moves and its only when their respective Wills become stronger that theyre able to out maneuver their opponent The Jedi use their calm and focus to strengthen their will while Sith use anger Besides lightsabers are meant to be flashy how can you say that this wasnt fun to watchhttpswwwyoutubecomwatchvyHqdESArkqU Like other people said there were a lot of problems with the first three movies but I dont think the fighting was one of them
2015-05-01 01:34:23,1,0,1,Focus,To be fair though the Suicide Squad episodes focused more or less on Deadshot and Diggles relationship and didnt focus on the team dynamic at all eg Bronze Tiger was relegated to a cameo and unceremoniously killed off in the comic
2015-05-01 01:58:36,0,0,0,Focus,We used to test peoples maturity based on that Did they focus on the meaning or the dick Not Snyders fault
2015-05-01 02:24:29,16,0,16,Focus,He was really quite weak compared to the Quicksilver from DoFP Thats half the reason they killed him off I reckon to eliminate the comparisons in future films Focus on SW instead
2015-05-01 02:54:33,440,0,440,Focus,When Cap said If you get killed walk it off line the shot was focused on Quicksilver too
2015-05-01 03:10:07,6,0,6,Focus,One involves tanks and military personnel The other is in a neighborhood focusing on two guys I liked them both but Children of Mens was more impressive
2015-05-01 03:13:24,5,0,5,Focus,Nah No elitism here thanks Especially minority focused stuff just meant to poop on people
2015-05-01 04:04:38,1,0,1,Focus,Im not convinced a good hacker movie can be made Not one that focuses a lot on actual hacking or other computer work Real hacking is generally nothing at all like the movies in two ways
2015-05-01 04:39:10,2,0,2,Focus,The only problem with that is the movie wanted needed to be very stereotypical Nathan is not unlike Steve Jobs in a sense trying to develop the next great product I say that lightly because these robots are his toys as much as his research Caleb is the stereotypical girlfriendless hacker The lab is very sterile and has very few details Almost clinical This is so we focus on the characters instead of excessive clutter The details that are there are significant as they are trying to point to the larger philosophy at hand
2015-05-01 04:43:59,2,0,2,Focus,I thought the film and novel it was based on was centered around the Battle for Mount Austen and therefore only focuses on that event  No need to go to Savo Island C co was never there
2015-05-01 04:45:50,2,0,2,Focus,I feel like these people were comparing it to the feeling of seeing these people together for the first time and nothing will ever stand up to that especially when the movie still focuses on the same team of 6 I think an extended version with more room for characters to breathe and interact will stand up The criticism that this movie is crowded is a little valid to me though I still love this movie
2015-05-01 04:47:07,1,0,1,Focus,A big problem is Marvels big focus right now are Cap3 Civil War and the Infinity War 2parter and Age of Ultron is kind of the monkey in the middle  Its honestly like how Iron Man 2 was where Marvel had to make a sequel no complaints but had the build the MCU so the story felt a little too hollow
2015-05-01 05:19:45,1,0,1,Focus,He was also the one they focused on and we saw his reaction to that line
2015-05-01 06:17:35,14,0,14,Focus,Thanks Now thats all I can focus on Wont even enjoy the fking movie now
2015-05-01 07:10:21,1,0,1,Focus,I liked it a lot I felt that some moments were a bit rushed but Ive heard theres a longer version so maybe that will allow more focus on characters I loved the new avengers idea and I thought James Spader was great I hope the extended edition if the rumors are true focus a bit more on him I would suggest seeing this movie in 2D though Ive watched the film in both formats and the 3D was just distracting I hate 3D anyways but this one was certainly unnecessary  I will say there are a ton of characters in this movie so its a wonder anyone had any development
2015-05-01 09:32:30,1,0,1,Focus,I didnt get it the first time I saw the movie  I was like what the hell is the deal with Ultron  But I get it now that Ive seen it again  He is totally phoning in Stark they even have the facial quirks RDJ does and little things like that  It makes 100 sense nowand of course he has Banners rage to bring it all into focus
2015-05-01 09:34:59,-7,0,-7,Focus,Oh the government will focus first on protecting them rather than our borders or the jobs of the Middle Class  Which reveals 1 who is master 2 their plan  Thanks for asking Im often unaware how vague I can seem  And koodos on use of the word guano its so rare you can use it in a sentence
2015-05-01 13:47:05,235,0,235,Focus,I get the feeling that hes a better actor than people give him credit for The writing on Arrow is very substandard especially with Berlanti and Kreisberg basically abandoning it to focus on The Flash
2015-05-01 14:04:39,1,0,1,Focus,Episodes 1 through 3 were minority focused now I mean there was Sam Jackson but that was pretty much it
2015-05-01 14:48:36,3,0,3,Focus,That definitely helps Having Johns involved will be a big factor when Berlanti amp Kreisberg reduce their Flash involvement to focus on getting the new spinoff and Supergirl off the ground
2015-05-01 14:56:49,1,0,1,Focus,I really wish we had more hulk in this movie They were really selling that he was going to be more of a focus but he really just had that one scene Dont get me wrong that hulk buster fight was awesome yeah and then we had a tiny bit of the hulk in the begining but then after that we barely see him again We didnt see him at all during the floating island until they all started fighting ultron to stop him from setting off his weapon Where was he at the rest of time Disapointed Other then that it was awesone Then again I could be biased I think the hulk is the best character on the teamId be fine with another incredible hulk movie
2015-05-01 15:16:48,6,0,6,Focus,At the time though it was completely groundbreaking A serious team focused super hero movie with no camp Hadnt really ever been done
2015-05-01 16:11:55,1,0,1,Focus,Fair enough  I just dont see his acting as anything special but its passable  The redeeming quality of the show in my opinion is that has a good story when its not focusing on the relationship drama especially the 2nd season
2015-05-01 16:16:04,3,0,3,Focus,Literally my same exact situation Lotr was and is my favorite cinematic experience ever and two towers is my favorite movie ever The epiceness and the adventure were so much better then anything I had ever seen and still to this day have yet to see anything that comes close to the scale of those movies Honestly my favorite part of the hobbit movies was apparently everybody else least favorite Its the beginning of the first one when we get introduced to bilbo and see gandalf for like 2 hours Just being back in that world was about as good as it gets Then it started to dawn on me as the movie went on that even without reading the childrens book I knew what was about to happen throughout most of the story It was too predictable and focused too much on CGI And dont even get me started on how unlikeable 78 out of the 105 dwarfs were that we were supposed to remember To this day I only remember thorin okanshiel or whatever the old one and gloin cause I read the fellowship thats all It was a mess and honestly Ive lost a lot of respect for Jackson for making a mockery of the amazing world he brought to screen 15 years ago damn Im getting old
2015-05-01 16:30:35,0,0,0,Focus,Yeah I probably came across like I dislike the show but I actually really like it when its not focusing on the relationship drama despite the acting being nothing special
2015-05-01 16:42:14,8,0,8,Focus,I loved The Wolverine Its gorgeous and the focus on character and theme is great Its the type of solo superhero film I wish wed see more of  one that dealt with consequences of past films and actually developed the character Its a great conclusion to Wolverines arc
2015-05-01 17:09:50,1,0,1,Focus,Origins is pretty much the only one worth skipping All the other ones are either mediocre but watchable or great wolverine builds off of the events in X3 but focuses on Logan and DoFP reboots the entire thing There are a few good things about origins namely the beginning half of the movie Its about average to when he gets his adamantium and then it just meh after that
2015-05-01 17:15:14,2,0,2,Focus,To be fair the turtles were perfect the movies problem was too much focus on an April that had no relation to the source material
2015-05-01 17:16:18,3,0,3,Focus,They didnt abandon it completely but they wanted to focus their efforts on Flash That left Marc Guggenheim as the main showrunner for S3 of Arrow Flash may run into a similar issue as Berlanti and Kreisberg are both set to be involved in both the new spinoff show and the new Supergirl show  which may leave Geoff Johns as the main showrunner for Flash
2015-05-01 17:42:48,15,0,15,Focus,Yea but does that translate well into film  Would a movie that focused on the drama between Cap and Iron Man be nearly as successful as its action packed counterpart
2015-05-01 18:19:00,2,0,2,Focus,I think it can  Character driven tension is more memorable than action In any movie  Which i think is why most sequels fall down because they focus more on the boom than on the lead up to it
2015-05-01 19:02:59,27,0,27,Focus,Avengers 1 had a better action balance though Sometimes you need slower dialogue focused scenes and there wasnt much of that at all in this movie
2015-05-01 19:13:59,5,0,5,Focus,So why do I always get attacked when I say Thor and The Wolverine are pretty good not Cap 2 good but better than IM3 good They focus on plot character a few emotions and dont have those GIGANTIC fights in the end Just a little bit of fighting and CGI and action and thats it Its different and I like that
2015-05-01 19:34:46,2,0,2,Focus,Personally I dont mind either way I absolutely loved AoU and was extremely satisfied with the amount of action in the film literally the only negative I have to say about it is the 3D conversion But I also immensly enjoy something like Daredevil with less CGI action scenes and more character focus
2015-05-01 20:52:34,2,0,2,Focus,Would be awesome to see them do a superhero movie like Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy With small segments of action but focusing on the tension and drama
2015-05-01 21:01:29,1,0,1,Focus,My favorite parts of Man of Steel were the flashback bits where he was in Smallville with Jonathan Kent They were great little character moments that helped show the type of man Clark was suppose to be because he had a great father Unfortunately these bits didnt play as big of a role in the movie and to be perfectly honest I would have loved a movie that focused more on his time in Smallville before he put on the cape but thats just me
2015-05-01 21:48:17,1,0,1,Focus,Hancock sort of fits even if it was pretty poorly executed Its an interesting take on character based movies but ultimately it comes back to the old rule of focusing on the most exciting part of your characters life which usually means action for superheroes
2015-05-01 21:50:37,16,0,16,Focus,You are mistaken Whedon is so totally a feminist  He doesnt want to film girls in revealing outfits or focus a lot on glorified female extras for no reason Hes Whedon guys
2015-05-01 21:52:54,1,0,1,Focus,Thats what most adaptations are and they turn out to be crap The Resident Evil movies are a prime example All the characters in the game wind up as cameos Worse yet theyre completely wrong The movies are so focused on their original settings its not even the same thing anymore
2015-05-01 22:17:08,5,0,5,Focus,I dont think they should take a break just focus on smaller stories instead of this grand galaxy wide spanding epic they are currently telling
2015-05-01 23:23:46,0,0,0,Focus,Personally Im glad they focus on the action  Thats what I came to see  I hate it when movies are all about feelings and indesicion  Unless the indecision is weather or not to launch a nuke
2015-05-01 23:57:49,2,0,2,Focus,I dont Youre high if you think he got a real crack at that script I mean he did and then an army of attorneys then every person that works in Disney then the marvel team responsible for their 55 year plan then he probably got to touch it before they had to film it Then focus groups and refilm Focus groups and edit Focus groups and retouch
2015-05-02 01:30:24,2,0,2,Focus,Its technically very impressive and Ellen Burstyn gives a truly excellent performance Really her storysubplot is the highlight of the film She may not be the focus but she steals the show Its worth the ticket
2015-05-02 02:03:31,3,0,3,Focus,I didnt miss Pym at all tbh The cast was already fully loaded and his role could have been served just as well by Stark and I do wish they would have focused on that a bit more Ultrons origin was a perfect fit for the MCU even if his characterization was kinda wonky
2015-05-02 02:37:51,1,0,1,Focus,I wish it had been more subtle I saw it coming with them focusing on it as thor set it down admist a are you a good guy conversation as well as with the earlier scene
2015-05-02 03:00:17,4,0,4,Focus,People died but considering the focus they put on evacuating the city and actually saving people i think it is safe to assume it was a low death count
2015-05-02 03:52:02,1,0,1,Focus,Worst one was the Gillette shaving cream on the corner of the sinktried to keep it out of focus but we know
2015-05-02 04:17:36,3,0,3,Focus,On youtube is the documentary 15 Days or Less which is about the making of 10 Items or Less starring Morgan Freeman Its the most comprehensive on the set experience Ive seen focusing mostly on below the line crew
2015-05-02 04:44:31,1,0,1,Focus,Why is this movie being treated as some moral standard for America Theres racism everywhere but you all are focused on an Adam Sandler movie Bravo America
2015-05-02 05:34:04,7,0,7,Focus,Definitely watch both They are vastly different movies in regard to the scope of their plot and characters so understand that going in Its not a bad thing by any means it just means the first one is tighter and more focused while the second is more vibrant and more expansive
2015-05-02 07:05:17,14,0,14,Focus,Its pretty amazing Little to no romance bullshit and when there is romance it makes sense Theres very little senseless character drama and it keeps the villain of the week trope to a minimum mostly focusing on the larger plot
2015-05-02 07:40:32,3,0,3,Focus,Thats the Marvel formula for you They create good popcorn flicks but end of the day thats all they are You could change the name to Iron Man 3 and the exact content of the thread stays the same Couldve been a good character study going in depth on the issues these heroes would have but it was the most humour focused MCU film until this one came out
2015-05-02 09:24:33,3,0,3,Focus,I thought Ultron was such a missed opportunity in that movie Imagine if they had focused more on his perspective He had access to all of the internet and could process it faster than anyone could ever imagine He also inhabited bodies in thousands of location simultaneously so I dont see why he didnt have backups saved across the world or why we didnt see more of his multiple pointsofview as camera shots Also werent all of the robots supposed to be about as strong as Iron Man They were pretty much pinatas
2015-05-02 14:07:00,1,0,1,Focus,They are so witty and inventive but never lose focus and just keep on entertaining
2015-05-02 14:19:59,2,0,2,Focus,It isnt really that racist movie even in the end Walt is a bit of a racist but that comes with all the other things he is He just hates pretty much everyone and everything so its not like he is focused on racism he just uses it among other things to tell people to fuck off He even befriends the kid and isnt that hostile towards the other Hmong people in the end Just cranky
2015-05-02 14:43:47,26,0,26,Focus,And they focus too much on Jane
2015-05-02 15:45:24,5,0,5,Focus,I loved the use of 3D to provide greater depth in Guardians of the Galaxy Ive always thought that elements popping out of the screen were kind of cheesy and gimmicky and only ever reminded me of the Terminator experience at Universal Studios The subtle use of 3D to simply give shots more depth really does feel like an advance in filmmaking technology that can be used for more than a cheap trick Tron and Avatar also did this but were more focused on enhancing specific visual components than the entire frame and you were always keenly aware that you were watching something in 3D  in GOTG it seemed more seamless and less obtrusive
2015-05-02 16:26:51,2,0,2,Focus,He was focused on saving Hawkeye not dodging bullets Also the Quinjet was firing a minigun at him IRL warships use guns like that to shoot down missiles moving several times the speed of sound
2015-05-02 17:47:53,2,0,2,Focus,Focus pulling is an art that rarely gets enough credit IMO
2015-05-02 19:00:36,2,0,2,Focus,Thats why the US campaign donation laws need to be reformed Theyre the root of many to most regulations not benefifical to the actual public Lawrence Lessig tried to fight for saner copyright for many years until he switched his focus to exactly that root problem httpmaydayus
2015-05-02 20:58:33,4,0,4,Focus,I wouldnt say theyre exactly the same movie and in many ways theyre different but I couldnt help but be reminded of 8 12 when I was watching Birdman Both movies focus on artists directors even who are trying to get over the expectations of people around them and delve into fantasy as both an escape and a means of trying to come to terms with themselves Also both movies use absurdity as a comic and artistic tool And both movies are very good
2015-05-02 21:13:16,11,0,11,Focus,The guy has a lot of focus and discipline Its commendable but you have to also remember this is his job with a million dollar incentive and he has a team helping him achieve this
2015-05-02 23:12:44,1,0,1,Focus,i dont know personally i like the movie better  it really does focus on different themes than the book
2015-05-03 00:00:34,1,0,1,Focus,You are correct in such an assessment but I feel the movie treads on the line so heavily that its going to either leave you satisfied or not at all Mostly because youre losing your suspension of disbelief while instead focusing on real world disparities
2015-05-03 01:04:24,2,0,2,Focus,No that was for elysium he refused because he wanted to focus on his new album
2015-05-03 01:11:29,-1,0,-1,Focus,I disagree Context is everything You cant take dialogue from Kill Bill and transplant it into Schindlers List It doesnt work that way When I watch a Star Wars film Im not focusing on how cheesy the dialogue is because I get where its coming from just like I get why Raimi films have campy dialogue that wouldnt be suitable for the real world Lord of the Rings also has clunky fantasy dialogue but it works and its entertaining
2015-05-03 02:49:30,14,0,14,Focus,Youre gonna focus on that when The Dark Knight Rises is in there
2015-05-03 06:01:16,2,0,2,Focus,It was scarier as a kid and when it happens to me I still hallucinate It really isnt a big deal now though My method for getting myself out of the state is to focus n wiggling my toes and it always works The worst hallucination I ever had was I had just moved into a new apartment on my own My stuff hadnt arrived yet so all I had was an air mattress in the middle of my empty bedroom I took a late afternoon nap and awoke to a sleep paralysis episode right at dusk Only a little light was coming into my room and I was laying on my stomach with my head to the side facing the edge of the air mattress I started to see first these long grey fingers begin slipping over the top of the air mattress followed by grey hands and arms They just kept extending towards me as I tried to focus on my toes I snapped out of it as the fingers were about to reach my face
2015-05-03 06:08:27,1,0,1,Focus,Im not a feminist at all I simply find it ironic that the Whedon insists hes one I wish hed keep his mouth shut about female empowerment and just focus on making a good movie
2015-05-03 07:00:27,-2,0,-2,Focus,Uh huh thats exactly the right assumption Hollywood mainly just focuses on the chest look at most fighters and atheletes and their chest doesnt stand out as much compared to the arms
2015-05-03 09:11:27,2,0,2,Focus,To me it stunk of a movie that started as a really good idea but then went through the hands of way to many movie execs and focus groups
2015-05-03 09:14:30,2,0,2,Focus,My very first instance of sleep paralysis was beyond horrifying because I woke up not being able to move anything but my eyeballs Eventually I couldnt focus on my breathing and each attempt was more of a desperate gasp As if that wasnt bad enough it dawned on me that as I struggled a shadowy hooded figure was swaying in the corner of my room just watching me I woke up as it started to fly towards me The most vivid one had a Grudgeesque lady demon crawl down from the ceiling climb up next to me to whisper something and then licked my ear with a long forked demon tongue I swear I could actually feel the dry tongue just lick up my ear Sleep paralysis is a bitch
2015-05-03 13:48:08,1,0,1,Focus,A lot of the focus its on the Academy that time of the year too  Instead of Blockbusters people were out watching the nominees at least where I come from
2015-05-03 15:44:04,-1,0,-1,Focus,And the point is that those things liking computers or comics arent inherently nerd things The inherently nerd thing is the overobsession and focused consumption
2015-05-03 16:09:10,14,0,14,Focus,I feel like a very very serious movie with The Purge concept would be really interesting All the violence on the streets would be kept in the background and the main focus would be on the politics behind it all how it was passed what caused it to happen
2015-05-03 16:58:57,3,0,3,Focus,Yep Meaning youre too focussed on the small things the trees that you cant see the big picture the forest
2015-05-03 17:03:34,6,0,6,Focus,Yeah that expression means that you focus too much on one part the treetrees and you miss the big picture the forest
2015-05-03 19:10:13,0,0,0,Focus,Quality wise maybe AoU was really the first MCU movie that felt like I was constantly being reminded that it was a franchise movie Hopefully at least the upcoming solo films have a little more focus and arent just stepping stones
2015-05-03 19:33:19,2,0,2,Focus,gtKey difference is having the stuff as a background part of a scene vs it being the sole focus of a scene
2015-05-03 20:10:02,-1,0,-1,Focus,Ive always found 3D distracting It forces you to focus where the director wants you to focus which sounds good but takes out a lot of the ambient stuff they put in to make the movie more real
2015-05-03 20:32:14,2,0,2,Focus,Obviously having a huge suit fighting The Hulk everytime they need him to calm down isnt the best route Thats why its shown twice that Black Widow uses her moves to calm him down Their fight scene was mostly meaning but there was reasoning Scarlett Witch was affecting all the Avengers minds in the scene so she was affecting Hulks too Thats why he is rampaging and needs someone to stop him It ties into The Hulk not feeling he can be trusted or be normal The problem that you may be having is they just kinda throw it in there and dont build upon it There rushing and no fleshing out of anything in this filmin a general level The action doesnt allow the eye to focus on anything so everything comes across as sloppy and way too ambitious Henceforth there is no suspense and makes it quite forgettable Winter Soldier is one of my favs along with Iron Man and GoTG and the action was so mich better in WS Im glad that the new directors of Avengers 3 are the directors behind Cap 2 and Cap Civil War So if Avengers 3 ends up like this beautiful mess of Avengers 2 then we know its Marvels fault and not the filmmakers
2015-05-03 21:08:54,19,0,19,Focus,I loved it and I think the characters they decided to focus on killed it
2015-05-03 23:06:21,1,0,1,Focus,I dont mind the muscles as long as theyre only part of the look I just hope they dont focus too much on the whole trainingfighting thing Weve seen that a million times before Besides I dont think this would contribute to the character The Jokers intention is to corrupt Batmans mind not to beat him in a physical fight Thats the whole point of the character and what makes him stand out from all the other villains Well well see anyways
2015-05-03 23:39:25,80,0,80,Focus,The dullrealistic route is fine with me just as long as Margots Harley is as bubbly as her comic book counterpart Like where everyone else is focused on getting the job done Harley wants to add fun to the job
2015-05-04 00:05:53,54,0,54,Focus,He used to be a major scumbag and then he found religion From that point on he became focused on righting the wrongs of his past He even risks his life to save Deadshot because he felt that Deadshot could still save his soul
2015-05-04 00:25:47,5,0,5,Focus,Deadshot just doesnt put up with the bs the characters bring hes more of a lets just work together and get this over with stay focused god damnit while all the other villians are constantly plotting to escapelet their personal flaws compromise the easy road on the mission
2015-05-04 00:31:02,3,0,3,Focus,Canary is more in focus and I honestly dont think Merlyn looks that great in the shot Either way they all look better when its a still promo image
2015-05-04 00:48:26,0,0,0,Focus,They look focusgrouped to hell
2015-05-04 02:14:20,9,0,9,Focus,The Avengers movies also have to maintain some sort of dramatic tension  If you just let Hulk wreck everyone theres nothing hanging in the balance nothing at risk  Thats why they have to focus on humans and the more vulnerable Avengers otherwise people get bored
2015-05-04 02:19:22,5,0,5,Focus,1 Too much story Movies that try to be allencompassing end up feeling rushed and movies that focus on one part never really feel that satisfying
2015-05-04 03:14:35,1,0,1,Focus,Im a little surprised by your comments concerning Coherence I actually really enjoyed it because of the characters When I was watching them they reminded me a lot of people I know IRL and how they might act in a similar situation Also I liked the fact that the film had a heavy focus on interpersonal drama because it grounded the scifi elements and made the plot as a whole more approachable even if towards the end it began to deteriorate
2015-05-04 03:18:09,2,0,2,Focus,I dont agree its the start of the end Were in the middle of an interesting fad where everything needs to be interconnected I hope we return to the focus of single entries SpiderMan The Dark Knight soon
2015-05-04 03:40:06,1,0,1,Focus,I did indeed notice her because shes the focus of the shot and is in several other scenes in the movie Everyone noticed her
2015-05-04 03:42:15,1,0,1,Focus,What Im saying is the scientific part is incidental and focusing on it is unhelpfulmisleading
2015-05-04 04:31:22,1,0,1,Focus,I cant wait until they only develop and focus on 23 of them and leave the rest as supporting characters
2015-05-04 04:37:32,2,0,2,Focus,Which is explained within the film this whole discussion is not about how the gems are portrayed in the film but if what happened in guardians of the galaxy is really relevant at all the the second avengers the stones themselves were hardly the focus in this movie it wasnt a macgruffin like the power gem was in GotG it was just an object that was used to give life to the vision
2015-05-04 04:54:53,4,0,4,Focus,I was really hoping AoU was building up to a sort of you cant save everyone scenario Until Fury showed up and killed any hopes I had of that of course With all the focus of the save everyone no casualties approach in the series I have a feeling that will end up being a major pivotal moment in Infinity War perhaps the end to part one
2015-05-04 05:36:11,2,0,2,Focus,Daredevil is a very different beast It had 3 times as long to focus on 13  the amount of characters
2015-05-04 05:40:50,1,0,1,Focus,I completely agree that the stones definitely werent focused on as heavily as GotG though still just as significant Id say purely because the stones are such powerful things But I do see what you mean now and that makes perfect sense
2015-05-04 06:09:06,1,0,1,Focus,this whole discussion is not about how the gems are portrayed in the film but if what happened in guardians of the galaxy is really relevant at all the the second avengers the stones themselves were hardly the focus in this movie it wasnt a macgruffin like the power gem was in GotG it was just an object that was used to give life to the vision
2015-05-04 06:41:54,1,0,1,Focus,Sucker Punch  I always felt if it didnt have any of the brothel junk and focused on the characters in the asylum taking drugs to get to the fantasy worlds it could have worked way better and The ending would leave it open whether the fantasy worlds were real  At least that would have made sense with them describing it as Alice in Wonderland with machine guns
2015-05-04 07:06:24,1,0,1,Focus,Im skeptical  I like DC so I will definitely see it but Ive not been that big of fan of Snyders other movies 300 SuckerPunch Watchmen I find him mostly too dark and focused on special effects rather than story or character  All that said I did like Man of Steel pretty well so well see how things go
2015-05-04 07:50:33,1,0,1,Focus,Yeah Im glad that the gore never really bothered me because I probably wouldnt have even been able to sit through the first one but I wasnt really focusing on that aspect of the films I can understand that it kept the torture aspect across all 7 films and with them progressing throughout them but I was more thinking about the storyline when I wrote this
2015-05-04 08:17:06,-4,0,-4,Focus,I love how Marvels style is to laugh your way through the villains Army invading Manhattan and threatening to destroyenslave life on Earth Teehee one liners as we toss around dozens of guys at the same time and the villain like a ragdoll Literally every villain of Marvel movie is evil for the sake of being evil focused on obtaining power for the sake of it in the form of some plotinduced object Tony Stark tech gem glove cube and gets roflstomped by the goodguys wisecracking their way through unstoppable armies which come from somewhere that hasnt the faintest clue how to command its elite forces and are just lambs led to slaughter
2015-05-04 13:00:55,1,0,1,Focus,I never thought of it as true to the lore at all I think its quite entertaining but no its nothing like the legends it focuses way too much on the romantic triangle It is however based off the Once and Future King which I think is the best modern literature adaptation of the legend
2015-05-04 13:57:09,2,0,2,Focus,Thats the point of the films in between the Avengers Movies  You get to know and care about the characters  In a big collaboration like the Avengers some of the personal and emotional touches are lost because you only get 25 hours to tell a story involving 8 or 9 crucial characters where as an Iron Man film focuses on Iron Man and a few side characters for 2 hours  Youre obviously going to be able to connect with Iron Man easier when he is the center piece of his own movie  You get a chance to get more in depth
2015-05-04 14:21:30,-8,0,-8,Focus,This sub jizzes all over Winter Soldier but that storyline went nowhere and the main focus was about Fury The subtitle should have been Rise of Fury or some shit like that cause WS did nothing in that film
2015-05-04 14:54:06,0,0,0,Focus,How was AoU a mess It was tightly ploted and though a lot of stuff seemed like convenience it wasnt the unfocused and clumsy mess that was the first half of Avengers
2015-05-04 15:12:31,2,0,2,Focus,Quite frankly thats a poor way of looking at the medium  While there are certain films that give more bearing to the written word than other plenty offer wholly unique cinematic experiences that distinguish them as an entirely separate art form  Most things from the silent era fall into this latter category  they focus more on the noseenscene and performance of the characters because the lack of sound prevents a reliance on dialogue  But even in the sound era plenty of works are heavily cinematic  The works of Terrence Malick Jodorowsky and Lynch for example all offer experiences that the written language could not hope to capture  The beauty of those works is entirely dependent on whats on the screen and not whats said
2015-05-04 15:55:12,-2,0,-2,Focus,No I said what you wrote the focussing on a mistyped word and then running away refusing to deal with the points made was fucking cowardice
2015-05-04 16:06:02,-1,0,-1,Focus,If you know how a movie is going to end there is little tension created in any of the scenes I know what you mean with the wouldnt it be cool if X fought Y But when we know the outcome it makes everything else in the process rather irrelevant And Avengers doesnt even have strong direction and action sequences to fall back on Theyre great but not memorable There is nothing that stands about Avengers apart from that a bunch of cool people get to fight cap Even the characters are pretty bland Thor Iron Man Hawkeye and Captain America are all tall buff handsome white guys who want to save the world have fight skills and come up with one liners every so often So we already have average CGI fight scenes and boring characters Well what about the contextplot whatever It certainly doesnt help because its focused on EXACTLY THOSE FIGHTS
2015-05-04 16:07:52,1,0,1,Focus,Especially after reading another post commenting on Slow Cinema Ive come to understand that Im drawn to the focus you get on the emotion in human nature and the psychology of the characters that comes with impressionstic filmmaking moreso over something with a more linear narrative focus
2015-05-04 16:26:15,14,0,14,Focus,But Star Wars is way less black and white than other epic tales such as LOTR or Harry Potter I think Star Wars focuses a lot on the idea that the Jedi Code is super flawed and that the Jedi are quite dogmatic in their beliefs No love no passion etc Also think of the many gray characters in the EU such as Kreia or Jolee in KOTOR KOTOR didnt just try to be sophisticated it was very clever
2015-05-04 16:42:06,84,0,84,Focus,Takeaway the death part focus on the broader Winter Soldier part  Spoilers below for anyone who hasnt seen Age of Ultron
2015-05-04 16:46:09,9,0,9,Focus,I find enormous comfort in the Marge character and the MargeNorm relationship Also the snowwhiteness of the landscape is really soothing I think these things serve to insulate against the darkness of the plot but I find these are the things I focus the most on Maybe not so crazy if you think about it
2015-05-04 17:04:12,2,0,2,Focus,Yes  Every time I hear a complaint about the darker tone of the trailer and MoS and statements like Supermans not supposed to be dark then Im just reminded of just how much many people dont know about Superman and his comic book history  The best Superman stories are the ones where the world around him is realistically gritty and morally imperfect and he is the contrasting beacon of hope and optimism  MoS centered around this very well but it isnt at all a perfect film  I think it shouldve been even longer and focused a bit more on his coming to terms with what he is  BvS is going to deal with the repercussions of a realistic world in which Superman exists not a shiny dreamlike imitation of the world where everyone loves him and roots for him  The guys behind these movies clearly love the characters and are portraying them with as much reverence and empathy that the mythology deserves
2015-05-04 17:23:11,1,0,1,Focus,No they arent the only archetypes and characters certainly can span a few of them  But they are the ones that Whedon focuses on almost exclusively which was the point
2015-05-04 18:27:32,1,0,1,Focus,If you dont like these movies then I can definitely see how studios focusing on them would make you upset But I think there is still a fair number of great movies coming out that we can have both
2015-05-04 18:55:22,2,0,2,Focus,Because it contributed to the characters In general the dialogue shouldnt be super focused on the story or you run the risk of turning characters into exposition machines
2015-05-04 19:22:06,26,0,26,Focus,Plus we obviously learn from AoU that Tony has refocused his attention in trying to create something that means the Avengers dont need to exist His distraction in IM3 was making suits for every occasion but now its trying to find the one automated suit fits all approach
2015-05-04 19:32:04,1,0,1,Focus,Because the Marvel movies have an actual god among them They focus on the humanistic traits They make superheroes identifiable and relatable Superman is not a grimdark hero Yes his powers make him godlike but it was always his struggle to be relatable to humans To fit in with a world where he did not belong Not mopey sad and grim Theres nothing enjoyable about Man of Steel Its a long hard slog with action sequences that took too long to end No one enjoyed those movies on the same level of satisfaction as say Ironman
2015-05-04 19:40:11,1,0,1,Focus,Gotcha Because from what I had heard about them was that they focused on Luke and friends rebuilding the order It doesnt look like that is what they are proceeding with
2015-05-04 19:40:35,2,0,2,Focus,The only thing i didnt like about the Bane trilogy was the final couple pages Bane Trilogy spoilers Where he body swaps into his apprentice and takes her over instantly after losing the fight and being beset by sith sorcery nightmares and inflicted by and i quote unimaginable pain hes somehow able to just snap his fingers and instantly invoke with no channel time or focus this amazingly complex sith ritual that he has studied but never attempted and does so successfully Bullshit Ruined the entire epic feeling the books had developed I cant even pretend he tried and failed because they made it so obvious he succeeded when heintheapprenticesbody was talking to new apprentice Had she actually won that fight like she was doing it would have stood as the culmination of his own beliefs A proper end to the first true sith and proof his way was right Would have been epic So disappointed in that ending gah end rant

2015-05-04 21:04:23,1,0,1,Focus,Peter dinklage as johns old buddy movie focuses on him for the first 30 min his problems then we first see john when he gets the call from peter asking for help Then the movie starts
2015-05-04 21:11:56,1,0,1,Focus,The end of ironman 3 was that everything he did was about him and being selfish and people got hurt because of him but it shows that he will start a new path but focus on protect the people around him and civillians hence thats why he built drones with the 3 laws of robotics laws like iRobot movie staring Will Smith Ultron was just another problem which showed whatever path he chooses bad will always happen
2015-05-04 22:48:10,1,0,1,Focus,I wasnt IN love with Brother Bear but I was very shocked to read the reviews it had afterward It seems the criticisms were more focused on its similarities to the cliches of 90s Disney films that felt formulaic at the time and talking little about the film itself as a solitary piece of work It was a whole was perfectly enjoyable with great visualdesign
2015-05-04 22:51:37,2,0,2,Focus,I like what we have of black widow Why dont they focus on writing her character better in movies she is in than getting her a solo film
2015-05-04 23:20:48,23,0,23,Focus,It was OK but not anything special If you are a hardcore Nirvana fan like myself aside from the home videos there really isnt anything here that you didnt already knowseen Its welledited and does a good job of portraying Cobains personality but way too much of it relies on prior source material that weve seen before They arent kidding when they call this Montage of Heck as this plays out a lot more like a 25 hour montage than an actual documentary There are some animated sequences that are pretty cool and visually cool but others get repetitive and feel straight up corny The interviews are good but they are very brief and make up little of the films running time It also really doesnt focus on Cobains work as an artist that made him so famous and skims over several very important events in his life It instead focuses on what factors made him such a strange individual which really arent that interesting I also HATED where they decided to end it By the end of it all it almost felt like the whole thing was just an excuse to build up to the home video footage of him and Love which while interesting to see is nothing fascinating Considering all the hype built up around this I couldnt help but walk away feeling disappointing considering this offered almost nothing new Hardcore Nirvana fans will be disappointed for the same reason I previously stated and those who arent too familiar with CobainNirvana will walk away feeling like they barely learned anything about the subject other than the fact he was a really fed up guy and will probably be turned off by the serial style Id still say its worth a watch but lower your expectations
2015-05-04 23:36:08,1,0,1,Focus,It wasnt clear to me if the coins were paid in addition to a fee or if fees were paid out with coins only The idea I had was that John had one coin for one kill but that didnt make sense given how many coins he gave for cleanup Part of the reason the use of the coins were so focused upon to me I thought was that each coin represented someones life that was taken and how quickly it was exchanged for something
2015-05-04 23:49:05,11,0,11,Focus,I really liked the ending actually Im glad they used this documentary to focus primarily on Kurts life rather than his death They have covered his death and his legacy afterwards in countless other documentaries and TV specials one is even coming out later this year that is entirely on his death
2015-05-05 00:03:52,3,0,3,Focus,Schindlers List and Flowers of War the first one you have already seen The second is a heart wrenching story that takes place during the Rape of Nanking it doesnt have much action in it but focuses on the struggles of the citizens from the viewpoints of schoolgirls a gaggle of prostitutes and an american mortician
2015-05-05 00:22:00,2,0,2,Focus,What if it were less of a killing spree and more of a focused mission where we see more of John Wicks other skills Driving detective skills etc That could be fresh and exciting
2015-05-05 01:03:10,1,0,1,Focus,Good of you to point that out even though I feel as if this particular scene was more of a maelstrom of anachronistic actions and short cuts to fit the music and the general chaotic mood whereas the marina scene was particularly focused on the visual aspect by the fact that there is a long slowmotion introduction and that you are meant to appreciate every moment of the following fight again through the use of slow motion
2015-05-05 01:53:18,1,0,1,Focus,I liked IM3 because it focused on Tony Stark the man rather than Iron Man Conversely that seems to be the reason a lot of people disliked it
2015-05-05 02:00:29,1,0,1,Focus,Classic revenge story with all the focus on the right things
2015-05-05 02:37:05,38,0,38,Focus,I would really like to see the grittier and shadier side of the Star Wars universe I wouldnt be surprised if Disney tried something edgier with the Star Wars franchise too given Daredevils reception Id certainly welcome a more contained storyline with a focus on bounty hunting and the underworld That aspect hasnt been much explored in the films
2015-05-05 02:39:28,3,0,3,Focus,I cant recall source but I believe thats how the original story goes where Keanus character was more backgroundside whereas I personally felt the movie focused more around him than the Ronin
2015-05-05 03:20:33,1,0,1,Focus,If this is pulled off well this has the potential to be a seriously cool movie Boba Fett doesnt have a lot going on in the original series and a standalone focusing on him could really add some great context to his character
2015-05-05 03:26:06,-5,0,-5,Focus,Well I agree that they are also crowding out the great action films but I would say its both the serious movies and the action films that are being hurt by the focus on movies geared towards the ComicCon crowd Look at this list of major releases from 1979 The Warriors Alien Rocky 2 Apocalypse Now Zulu DawnI do miss stuff like the original Rambo Serious action movies
2015-05-05 03:44:33,3,0,3,Focus,The Raid is basically Die Hard plus Dredd with a focus on martial arts instead of guns  Its a more focused consistent movie than Raid 2
2015-05-05 04:06:47,9,0,9,Focus,Not to mention right as he talks about how with or without the suits he is Iron Man he picks up a screwdriver with the clear implication that he will continue to build and create things as The Mechanic  meaning he will continue to upgrade the Iron Man suits but not in a way that detracts from his relationship from Pepper  This of course leads to the Tony in AOU  his main focus is protecting the world but finding a way that he can retire  Tony feels that protecting the world is his responsibility and as we see in his vision thinks that ultimately its all on him  This demonstrates multiple aspects of his personality  his goodness and sense of duty but also his narcissism
2015-05-05 04:38:13,1,0,1,Focus,Focus Shouldve left when the football scene ended
2015-05-05 06:26:31,2,0,2,Focus,My theory was that 90 of the writers time on that movie was spent brainstorming the most righteous reason for him to go on a rampage  It was like they outsourced it to a thinktank and did months of focus group testing until they got it just right
2015-05-05 07:13:40,2,0,2,Focus,But wasnt Jarvis controlling all the automated suits in Iron Man 3 Tony wasnt flying them all around himself and in fact he was communicating with Jarvis to tell him where to focus the attacks in the end of Iron Man 3 The only real difference is that the Iron Legion are drones rather than suits that he can put on and this is a really negligible difference in terms of Tony taking a dramatically new path
2015-05-05 07:16:15,8,0,8,Focus,Honestly his death has been beaten to death over the years Theres nothing else to show for that This finally focused in his life
2015-05-05 09:01:35,2,0,2,Focus,I saw it today It was pretty good but not great I liked it but I wouldnt say its one of my favorite Marvel films As a whole I think it wanted to do too much Because of this it kind of felt unfocused I especially thought that the Black WidowBruce Banner and Hawkeyes family subplots could have been eliminated or at least decreased It was entertaining all the way through but it really felt like it was just treading water until we get to Thanos Part of the problem may be that we already kind of know how the movie will end since they have announced the Marvel movies for the foreseeable future
2015-05-05 09:39:34,3,0,3,Focus,YAY I am not alone Mind you I liked Captain America as well as Iron Man but everyone else I wasnt a fan of Also the plot felt too unfocused I mean all of their individual movies I generally liked but the movie just had no suspense since the heroes werent in any sort of threatening situation While their individual movies it felt like there was real danger by the antagonists of the story at hand
2015-05-05 09:41:30,1,0,1,Focus,I feel like thats what movie watching with most of reddit would be like Focus on something its obvious the writers gave no thought to because zomg future continuity rather than the emotion and deeper meaning of a movie

2015-05-05 09:51:39,2,0,2,Focus,I honestly have no idea The team seems to be based on the New 52 version of the Suicide Squad but weve been hearing rumours that make it sound a little bit like Assault on Arkham an animated movie focusing on them which involved them breaking into Arkham Asylum to capture Riddler for reasons It could literally be anything though and given their choice of director probably wont hold back anything
2015-05-05 12:24:21,1,0,1,Focus,Webb was brought on to do a completely different type of SpiderMan film The original concept was from my understanding to do a series of films involving a teenage SpiderMan that focused heavily on the characters romance comics roots while sprinkling in action scenes However studio interference resulted in a butchered script and film that kept changing resulting in a finished product that was clearly an amalgam of several different visions and scripts This was repeated and done even worse with the sequel
2015-05-05 12:44:46,4,0,4,Focus,How dare he make a woman who in a league of boys has no powers but can kick just as much ass as her male superpowered counterparts Ugh and he doesnt want her to be alone How dare he want his character to chase after happiness That pig And he DIDNT spend the whole movie with the camera focused on her boobs I mean shes a strong woman who worked out for that body How dare he not glorify it the whole movie by making everything a Micheal Bay zoom in on her body Cant believe it
2015-05-05 13:12:19,1061,0,1061,Focus,From the first few pages Lucas is really the voice of reason  Spielberg is throwing out stuff like Indy should use the whip to stop a girl from leaving he should be a good gambler etc  Lucas is more focused on the imagery of the whip and making Indy have some relatable vulnerabilities
2015-05-05 13:13:50,1,0,1,Focus,It wasnt signs in the street it was that they kept setting scenes outside of the stores and having the big block letter signs near center of frame and in focus the whole time  They also went out of their way to get a character become an IHOP employee so they could have him in uniform in the movie and Im pretty sure he says some stuff about IHOP too  It was pretty blatant
2015-05-05 13:17:45,382,0,382,Focus,I dont know why everyone focuses on the fridge scene when an hour later Shia Lebouf swings through the jungle on vines like Tarzan somehow befriending an army of monkeys one of which has his same haircut for some reason and then the monkey army and Shia attack the bad guys together
2015-05-05 13:18:06,587,0,587,Focus,Im surprised at how many great ideas Lucas was throwing out He was leading this conversation Spielberg seemed to be more focused on minor details of certain scenes meanwhile Lucas was giving 10 minute speeches about the ideology of the character
2015-05-05 13:37:36,-1,0,-1,Focus,I thought Raid 2 was a massive disappointment  I loved how selfcontained the first one was both in terms of narrative and setting  The 2nd one was too sprawling with not enough focus or emotional center
2015-05-05 14:19:01,1,0,1,Focus,Funny enough Cary Fukunaga just made a big deal about Hollywood not having original ideas and focusing on recycled content and that it is ruining the industry
2015-05-05 15:15:06,45,0,45,Focus,It had so much potential to be a really good movie but because George didnt have anyone to challenge him or tell him no there wasnt any balance and everything became sloppy and unfocused I really liked reading this transcript because it shows how a collaboration between three brilliant filmmakers really made Raiders such a great movie
2015-05-05 15:45:43,1,0,1,Focus,Why the fuck do people hate on this movie so much I mean yeah I can get that people didnt like it because of how all over the place it was but shit like this is just stupid Black Widow is a badass she calms the hulk back down into Bruce Banner Of course they have to have serious trust between each other And for them to have that kind of trust it makes sense that Black widow and Bruce Banner would be in a relationship My only gripe with the love interest is that they never built up to it Like there was never a hint about this relationship in any of the movies prior to Age of Ultron I know its not a major thing the other films should focus on but its kinda weird that it just came out of nowhere
2015-05-05 15:57:50,2,0,2,Focus,Its like the minor anime character deaths  as soon as you get some good amount of backstory or focus on this random dude you havent seen much of you know the end is nigh
2015-05-05 16:11:22,2,0,2,Focus,The problem with that is that people actually need to understand a character and take their time to read into them which is difficult for people that live off of blindly hating everything that doesnt align with their frankly uneducated world view A lot of these people ask for decent portraying of women in media but dont actually have a clue what that means They probably think that a woman is only empowered when she is beating people up which is a ridiculous idea by itself there are so many facets to people and all you are going to focus on is physical strength Hint Theyve got the hulk they dont need Black Widow for punching things Let me give you some other examples
2015-05-05 16:12:37,14,0,14,Focus,Yeah I was focusing on Georges reaction Well have to work that part out
2015-05-05 16:13:36,4,0,4,Focus,Exactly she was trained to kill without remorse To focus solely on the mission Nothing would ever be allowed to be important having biological children would always be the potential more important than the mission Her trainers sought to remove that liability
2015-05-05 17:05:29,1,0,1,Focus,I think the problem as in a lot of other areas is the extremism These Tumblr Feminists are losing their shit largely over really petty stuff They could be making a serious fight against the antibirth control types or racism in law enforcement but theyre focusing all their energy on insignificant shit like this movie and people making casual references to things from other cultures And theyre actually doing it to the point of sending threats over this petty shit They do all this as if policing the way other people talk is really making a serious difference and not just the tiniest bit of windowdressing
2015-05-05 17:29:12,4,0,4,Focus,Well it was Georges idea that had gestated since childhood but while Spielberg is throwing out crazy ideas his sensibilities are what the audience will enjoy from moment to moment Hes very concerned about being entertaining Lucky for him he can back it up with amazing craft and stay focused on the big picture most of the time
2015-05-05 17:44:55,1,0,1,Focus,Its all good Marvel movies are pop music and honestly Im a big fan of both they have their place I dont think its degrading but their challenges focus more on how to market themselves to a mass audience and appeal to everyone without growing boring and formulaic too fast obviously a growing problem with marvel Its totally fair to critique the movie how youd critique any other movie but when looking at the choices they make its important to recognize the context and reasoning
2015-05-05 17:49:04,1,0,1,Focus,Make it kind of like the old TroopshttpswwwyoutubecomwatchvLvswNDAAZCU fan film but just focus on the bounty hunters
2015-05-05 18:19:01,2,0,2,Focus,Well whats the definition of sexualizing a character  That theyre there just for the objectification of sex  That it focuses on their worth as an object to fulfill a purpose
2015-05-05 18:30:10,2,0,2,Focus,I thought it was blatantly obvious ther were setting him up for death The whole ill fix the sunroom when I get back and then ill have stop working on projects and focus on my family its the same thing as the two weeks from retirement trope when characters promise to do something when they get back they never get back
2015-05-05 18:52:45,4,0,4,Focus,I would agree with you on 2 but I disagree on 3 I loved the focus on Stark as a character and his PTSD following The Avengers I also thought the Mandarin twist was refreshing and completely unique
2015-05-05 18:59:05,81,0,81,Focus,I read Civil War a few months ago Its very Captain America focused
2015-05-05 19:19:14,3,0,3,Focus,The Station Agent is a great characterdriven movie Its available on Netflix US if youre interested It stars Peter Dinklage Bobby Cannavale and Patricia Clarkson The movie focuses primarily on the three lives of their characters intertwining and their relationships with Dinklage being the main character Its a great movie to sit down and watch especially if youre in the mood to laugh and cry
2015-05-05 19:20:07,0,0,0,Focus,The last one was so badI was hoping they would make it slightly more modern and focus on making the plot more logically sound and realistic
2015-05-05 19:41:00,13,0,13,Focus,So Joss was focused on individual characterization and the studio was focused on future movie setup
2015-05-05 19:41:12,1,0,1,Focus,People focus on the fridge scene because it happened first then they just shut their brain off and no one can remember the rest of the movie
2015-05-05 19:44:49,13,0,13,Focus,Honestly id have preferred Joss to have made a smaller script that was a lot more character focused The moments at the farm and at the party with all the Avengers together were some of the best in the film Focusing more on them as heroes and their issues with Stark with what he done would have been better Essentially the film should be about the Avengers and Ultron Not have elements to tie in future films like Ragnarok especially since no one really cares for Thor anyone Thats the issue with having connected films though I guess theyre bound to get in the way in some way or another
2015-05-05 20:02:23,1,0,1,Focus,I understand why youd be worried but Im not  I think these other characters will be in it for support but the main plot and storybeats will really focus on Cap
2015-05-05 20:22:33,6,0,6,Focus,Here is a more detailed explanationhttpwwwsecurityfocuscomnews4831
2015-05-05 20:24:38,1,0,1,Focus,I agree  i thought it was too long and there was so much in it that I had seen before  As a big fan of Cobain I hate to say it but he had no business having a kid  Those two were absolutely unfit to be responsible for an infant  MOH really brought that into focus for me
2015-05-05 20:26:57,2,0,2,Focus,I think the thing I liked is how much of the focus was on the bad guys We got to see just how scared they were and the desperate lengths theyd go to I was much more refreshing that say Equalised when the main character is also a bad ass but they showed it more from his perspective only and I think it suffered for that
2015-05-05 20:30:14,1,0,1,Focus,Also people forget that this film took place in the 50s so there was more of a focus on Bmovie Sci fi which represented the era This one was more like aliens in the Aztec which totally would have been an old pulp mag in the 50s
2015-05-05 20:48:49,2,0,2,Focus,I think Tony did too good of a job cleaning up after him for that to really blow up That said the focus on civilian casualties in Age of Ultron is definitely a setup for whatever happens in Civil War
2015-05-05 20:54:21,5,0,5,Focus,The thor and iron man movies had that also It was a bit frustrating I like the focus on fun and adventure in the Marvel films but they could certainly afford to tune it down a bit
2015-05-05 21:02:48,1,0,1,Focus,The movie looks wonderful Its so colorful I couldnt focus on the trailer and just kept staring at the backgrounds
2015-05-05 21:15:15,1,0,1,Focus,Eh Id say its very Spiderman focused with Tony taking second place and then Captain America
2015-05-05 21:16:09,29,0,29,Focus,Iron Man 2 loses some focus during the middle portion of the second act primarly after the TonyRhodey fight scene but it picks up quickly after Ivan calls Tony and Tony gets the new arc reactor Its not as terrible a movie as people make it out to be
2015-05-05 21:17:08,2,0,2,Focus,He draws his powers from the magic of the UK since it is a point where the boundaries of the physical and magical realm are blurred His suit helps him to focus this power although he didnt used to need it There is a Captain Britain in every universe and together they form the Captain Britain Corp which works to protect the multiverse
2015-05-05 21:37:53,1,0,1,Focus,That role will most likely shiftadapt to The Winter Soldier Russos love the Winter Soldier and said this movie will focus a lot on him
2015-05-05 21:57:12,1,0,1,Focus,He didnt give up on Iron Man He just decided he would focus less on being Iron Man
2015-05-05 22:01:05,2,0,2,Focus,Thats supposed to be the appeal The film is a character study and an astonishing number of people fail to understand that instead focusing on the thin plot which is thin for a reason
2015-05-05 22:05:13,14,0,14,Focus,We got the Mandarin Guy Pierce played him He spoke in proverbs he had a fascination with asian culture he focussed on deception and behind the scenes work he used a decoy he had bigass dragon tattoos he even had the businessman look of Ultimates Mandarin
2015-05-05 22:12:09,3,0,3,Focus,It was the first fight hed ever been in the first time hed ever used his powers to any big extent and he was fighting someone who was not only singularly bred for combat but was actively trying to cause as much destruction as possible I can forgive him for not being perfect and focussing more on not dying
2015-05-05 22:38:36,6,0,6,Focus,Yeah I mean she was talking about going to fucking murder school and they focus on that one line Jesus people have some sense of perspective
2015-05-06 00:34:59,4,0,4,Focus,gtIt also really doesnt focus on Cobains work as an artist that made him so famous and skims over several very important events in his life It instead focuses on what factors made him such a strange individual which really arent that interesting
2015-05-06 04:14:08,1,0,1,Focus,I could be wrong but I thought I read that they invented an entire new camera setup to achieve the stunning 3D effect Normal cameras are spaced apart while Avatars cameras where spaced and TURN INWARD similar to how both eye in a human turn inward on the focus This help create a seen which is very similar to what the eye sees
2015-05-06 04:39:40,2,0,2,Focus,Cloud Atlas I heard such good things about it and I was 2 and a half hours in an a bit let down Then that speech from Hugo Weaving and that beautiful montage which just brought the entire film into focus
2015-05-06 04:48:54,1,0,1,Focus,It depends if the directors have respect for the comics I think that some things have to be changed or cut out from the comics when making a movie The comics go on forever and there are so many storyline A movie can only focus on a few things before things get too crazy Thats the problem people are seeing with the avengers It has too many characters and strange plot points plus having to introduce new characters and easter eggs
2015-05-06 05:38:43,3,0,3,Focus,Im glad someone agrees it just feels like the subreddit is pretending to be something it isnt its a look more suited for a sub about film heritage or classical cinema and this sub has not ever in recent memory been about that no one posts that kind of content here and if they do then its largely lost Whether the mods or diehard fans like it or not this sub is largely focused on contemporary cinema blockbusters news and the like At minimum I would love to see more colour
2015-05-06 06:07:06,1,0,1,Focus,Wouldnt it be interesting if John Wick 2 focused on someone other than John Wick within this world that we got glimpses of and the movie ends with some amazing fire fight between John Wick and this other player
2015-05-06 06:30:06,1,0,1,Focus,I hate that show so much It had so much potential A world where basically everything mythical exists in high volumes amongst normal human beings and casting an obvious social commentary on bigotry and narrowmindedness Aaaaand they focus on how many wacky sex scenes they can work into each episode Thats really my issue with all premium TV shows Just because they can show most anything they stuff as much of what they can show into each episode Im not a fan of gratuity Cut it to half an hour and Ill spend the other half watching actual porn
2015-05-06 07:13:59,1,0,1,Focus,Stark was always talking about the endgame envisioning a world protected by a suit of armor where an alien invasion is stopped early because they couldnt get past the bouncer I believe Tony was essentially trying to make an immortal robotic version of himself one that can keep his focus on the endgame long after Tony grows old and dies Being the egomaniac he is Tony would think nobody else would be better suited for the job then himself That way his robot version can continue doing his job for him and he can go off retire and enjoy life
2015-05-06 09:24:28,1,0,1,Focus,How about we just focus on the Uncharted movie for now
2015-05-06 11:01:06,1,0,1,Focus,I did the same thing moves like that are much easier to watch at home where you dont have to completely focus on it and your not paying 20 bucks to watch it
2015-05-06 11:16:41,3,0,3,Focus,gta fascination with asian culture he focussed on deception and behind the scenes work he used a decoy
2015-05-06 11:51:25,1,0,1,Focus,Well Spielberg was actually making Indiana Jones after being refused a James Bond movie and everything iconic about Indiana Jones was created by Lucas Spielberg wanted him to be a gambling drinking womanizer  focusing more on action sequences You can thank Lucas in his prime for that
2015-05-06 14:18:53,0,0,0,Focus,Right on Same here I like how boring and focused he is As a boring and focused guy who often times has to wrangle the more enigmatic friends in situations I sympathize Even the language bit fit for me I cant tell you how many times Ive had to keep friends form cussing up a storm in front of grandmothers kids and administrators out in public But I admit I am also super lame Haha
2015-05-06 14:38:36,2,0,2,Focus,My thinking is that the images of the stones and thanos were so brief in his vision that he missed them but remembered their importance subconsciously By going into the pool he was able to reexperience the vision and focus on the parts he missed
2015-05-06 15:31:42,3,0,3,Focus,I dont know about you guys but the subltle product placement is what turned me off from this movie I mean for fucks sake lets zoom out and focus in on a goddamn bottle of shaving cream after a sappy scene
2015-05-06 15:33:36,-1,0,-1,Focus,Surprised with how many people enjoyed the farm scene Thought it and the overfocus on Hawkeye was unnecessary
2015-05-06 16:07:46,1,0,1,Focus,She was actually on that path when she started her relationship with Iceman in The Last Stand She still wanted to get rid of her powers but you could tell she was coming out of her shell If they keep up with the rebooted First Class universe I could see them doing one more movie with Year One Rogue to reintroduce her focus the story on her coming to accept herself amp not see herself as some kind of uncontrollable vampire and then go with the vivacious Rogue everyone wants to see from then on out
2015-05-06 17:19:07,2,0,2,Focus,Some of the science didnt necessarily add up  the plot felt way too jumpy  I think they were introducing too many new characters and not focusing on some of the others that already were in MCU  Ultron plan to destroy the world didnt make sense  in the way he was going to do it  The romantic tryst of Bruce Banner and Black Widow came out of no where as well  I mean  I really did enjoy it  Im def gonna watch it again in theaters
2015-05-06 17:42:10,5,0,5,Focus,I enjoyed it precisely because it focused partly on Hawkeye
2015-05-06 17:43:27,16,0,16,Focus,I think Sofia Coppola was alright agreed the last scene from the movie was pretty bad But aside from that she had a very innocent touch to the part It was not a great casting decision and not a bad one either just okay Also many greatly attribute the failure of Part 3 due to her which seems ridiculous Part 3 is bad because it didnt have as strong a screenplay as the rest the absence of Robert Duvall and it focused on the Corleone family trying to distance itself from the Crime World
2015-05-06 18:21:20,2,0,2,Focus,What pissed me off about that scene was the random 911 imagery I mean I get that movies have been having a huge impact on the healing from 911 for Americans I mean I still think War of the Worlds 2005 without the sound on is the best movie to express post911 fears but the dust settling over people because of an empty construction site being collapsed It seems a bit of an empty metaphor no one died in that Im not American so I cant comment on 911 much but Im from Ireland and considering the Troubles weve had over here it felt to me like a car exploding in the middle of the road isnt an immediate metaphor for all the deathpain caused by that event Maybe Im reading way too much into this I did watch Ultron in the middle of my college focusing on metaphors as a method of psychological healing but it felt really empty and forced to me
2015-05-06 18:41:59,1,0,1,Focus,The Place Beyond The Pines does this very well Each act has a focus on a different person in the story
2015-05-06 18:43:02,1,0,1,Focus,I wish they had made Black Widow the focus of her and Hulks romance rather than focusing on Banner and having her act as his love interest In a romantic context Black Widow is a much more interesting character than Bruce Banner because shes so used to feigning vulnerability to get the best of people so it would have been really interesting to see her truly deal with the idea of actually dealing with an emotional vulnerability rather than just having to watch Bruce Banner wallow in selfpity for 2 hours
2015-05-06 18:48:43,2,0,2,Focus,Neither was anything like comicQuicksilver  What I found to be nice commercial maneuvering was that while both movies featured both siblings Scarlett Witch was a child and not displaying powers in DoFP the stroylines allowed them to show how each universe was going to focus on only one of the characters leaving the other character to be used by the other company
2015-05-06 18:52:07,1,0,1,Focus,Oooo thats interesting youre right each franchise focused more on a different sibling
2015-05-06 19:34:23,1,0,1,Focus,I Spit on Your Grave 1978 Camille Keaton version God that rape scene I felt like it was never going to endjust when you think shes gotten away BAM they found her againin the woods in the cabin The last half of the movie focusing on Jennifers revenge was nothing compared to the rape
2015-05-06 19:38:36,1,0,1,Focus,I have I like The Retrieval better Glory lags at some points and I wish that they focused more on Denzel and Morgan Freeman and less on Matthew Broderick Broderick is a decent actor and all but come on Denzel is probably one of the best actors in modern history At least top five
2015-05-06 22:39:25,1,0,1,Focus,Its not just the effects but its an extremely cgi focused film so its going to cost that much Big actors massive amounts of elaborate special effects etc its costs a lot And they can spend it because they own the box office right now
2015-05-06 22:50:58,1,0,1,Focus,Leon is a lot more focused Big Blue is one of the most fascinating movies Ive seen but its messy as hell
2015-05-06 23:31:21,3,0,3,Focus,Yeahhh but those movies failing had nothing to do with the lead characters gender and had everything to do with the fact that they were shit movies So if they want to avoid the same mistakes instead of focusing on avoiding female leads they should focus on not making a piece of shit movie
2015-05-07 00:53:06,2,0,2,Focus,This is Joshua Oppenheimers followup to his 2012 documentary The Act of Killing which was one of the most powerful documentaries I have ever seen  Where Act of Killing focused on the perpetrators of the Indonesian genocide The Look of Silence will focus on a family that survived  It has been getting amazing reviews so far
2015-05-07 02:01:55,0,0,0,Focus,Come on man Really I HATED Marion I seemed like a great idea on paper but she looked horrible and could not act The chemistry between Shia and Harrison was great and the movie should have just focused on them That love story felt shoe horned for no reason
2015-05-07 04:03:12,5,0,5,Focus,Quite the opposite actually It was controversial in its day because it showed Jesus as a human being and focused on his more human side including how he dealt with temptation
2015-05-07 04:46:33,5,0,5,Focus,Yes and no The DP decides what camera to use what lens the focus and lightning The director may say he wants a shot a certain way but its up to the DP to make the shot work
2015-05-07 05:13:29,3,0,3,Focus,Nothing close Its Kurbricklite by way of James Cameron if Cameron tried his hand at auteur filmmaking But it parallels the same ideas that Transcendence tried to tackle but its better since the main focus isnt providing some sort of spectacle The closest corollary to Tarkovskys 4 minute highway car trip is the dinner scene between Chris and Rea Lots of decisions to cut the sound out Its not as expressionistic but theres a lot of meat there
2015-05-07 05:29:42,2,0,2,Focus,I think youre misunderstanding what a cinematography decision is Of course a director that likes long takes is going to have long takes in his movies regardless of who the DP is But Paul Thomas Anderson isnt the one behind the camera The DP has to figure out the logistics of making the longtake work what lens to use when to change focus where is the camera going to be and when Is it on a dolly Where is the dolly track going to be laid How fast is it going to have to move down the track to keep up with the actor The director doesnt know those things he just knows he wants a long take Its the DPs job to make that stuff work
2015-05-07 08:05:05,0,0,0,Focus,I heard it focuses the plot on April more than it should have Same issue with Transformers
2015-05-07 08:37:06,26,0,26,Focus,I feel like basing age appropriateness on themessage of the movie could get pretty confusing at times Because each person can take something different from a movie I think the MPAA should focus more on violence and then the rest should be left to parents to decide
2015-05-07 09:51:23,4,0,4,Focus,It did have a fair amount of comedy in it but there was some solid drama focused stuff in that film It wasnt all Goofy Carrey like Bruce Almighty or Ace Ventura
2015-05-07 11:28:21,4,0,4,Focus,Well to be fair iron mantony stark would also be an integral part The best way to do this movie would to make it equal parts iron man and capt and make it so theres no clear bad guy This way the audience is divided on which side to pick which creates a much more fun and meaningful movie Tony Starks side and reasoning in the civil war is actually something I find fascinating and intriguing I will be extremely disappointed if they focus almost completely on capt and ignore iron man
2015-05-07 13:22:35,1,0,1,Focus,Nope That is the consequence of building a storyline Those gems are central to the Marvel universe Ignoring them would just incite fanboy riots and at least this way gives them a focused overarcing plot
2015-05-07 14:13:44,9,0,9,Focus,So question Movies are already focus tested Why not simply ask the audience what do you think this movie should be rated and then take the average of that
2015-05-07 14:47:06,1,0,1,Focus,Robin Williams in One Hour Photo or Greg Kinnear in Auto Focus
2015-05-07 14:53:24,6,0,6,Focus,Oh yeah that was pretty good Its just a shame that we didnt see more of it Hopefully its a big focus in this new series
2015-05-07 15:01:42,4,0,4,Focus,He blows up his suits and sheds his hehe I AM IRON MAN hobby for a new wave of unwearable Iron Legion drones which is much more in line with I am literally the only person on this team who can actually save us all His exact line is a clean slate at the end of Iron Man 3 hes restarting the program and focusing purely on damage control and containment as opposed to indulging in I wonder what I should name my heavy lifting suit Hes decided to stop fucking around basically and devote himself to making more of a change for the whole world
2015-05-07 15:08:12,1,0,1,Focus,I mean as is those focus groups are held by the studios It makes sense to ask by the way R PG13 on the way out but it still would leave the whiff of rating yourself And itd hamper indy filmmakers who already have trouble through the distribution network
2015-05-07 15:18:23,352,0,352,Focus,Id say Kangaroo Jack I remember from my childhood the previews focussed a lot on a talking kangaroo Then when the movie came out It was only a one minute scene of the main character going crazy in the desert
2015-05-07 15:26:45,2,0,2,Focus,It doesnt need to be the focus but seriously what good is a superhero if he isnt protecting people just bringing his grudge matches to our planet
2015-05-07 15:38:40,6,0,6,Focus,Wasnt the last one supposed to be a quadrilogy too How about they focus on making one good fucking movie first
2015-05-07 15:39:56,-3,0,-3,Focus,No conflict is not exclusive to story The concept of conflict in film and television is not restricted by action or dialog and never has been Its also within visual representation I can say with certainty the films you linked to yes even the first film has a level of conflict in the way its shot and the images the audience is presented With some art films this conflict transcends the screen and focuses on the audience reaction to what theyre seeing such is the case with the first film you linked The opening shots of which are a prime example of this
2015-05-07 15:52:06,1,0,1,Focus,3D makes you nauseous when you look at the background Your eyes converge point at the object youre looking at and at the distance youre focusing at Cameras converge and focus on the object the film makers want you to look at When you look at the background the convergence between your eyes and the cameras mismatches and really messes with your mind
2015-05-07 15:59:02,1,0,1,Focus,Of all the reasons that movie was shitty and abomination you choose the race to focus on
2015-05-07 16:13:27,3,0,3,Focus,Marvel are keeping things close to their chest But alot of Phase 3 will be focused on Thanos gathering the 6 infinity stones to power the gauntlet which he will presumably do byin Infinity War
2015-05-07 16:13:39,1,0,1,Focus,There are more than five characters at least to begin with but John Carpenters The Thing is focused on a small area War In The Pacific features just Marvin and Mifune trapped on an island A lot of films adapted from plays like Twelve Angry Men keep to a fairly claustrophobic setting
2015-05-07 17:00:56,9,0,9,Focus,you would think but insiders are still saying this is very much a Cap movie  The plot itself might be focused on him but i dont see how you can do that and have this many characters that need to take up screentime without it really being Avengers 25
2015-05-07 17:10:42,1,0,1,Focus,How about they focus on making one good movie before planning so far ahead
2015-05-07 17:34:07,4,0,4,Focus,I hear a lot of people saying that but I think that due to the nature of the story itll be more like Winter Soldier in how it largely focused on two characters in this case Steve and Tony instead of being a true ensemble Sure there are a lot of players but the real story and drama is going to be squarely on them The rest of the cast are probably going to be more like chess and mouthpieces to define and show the ideological divide
2015-05-07 17:36:43,5,0,5,Focus,He will be starring in a movie about the Irish Famine after this as he wants to focus on more serious roles you heard it here first
2015-05-07 17:42:08,3,0,3,Focus,The comicbook plot is very focused around Cap as well But I dont think the Russos would NOT give cap his cap movie
2015-05-07 17:44:31,1,0,1,Focus,Gives me headaches too and i have to squint my eyes to focus
2015-05-07 17:52:56,1,0,1,Focus,Theres a fair bit of underlying conflict The movie doesnt focus on it but its there
2015-05-07 18:22:36,1,0,1,Focus,I went on a date with a chick to see Interstellar and once the movie was over I couldnt help but keep talking to her about it and just how breathtaking it was I was definitely out of my element for a while Most likely pissed her off how I was more focused on the film than the date
2015-05-07 18:27:15,1,0,1,Focus,Meh Ill agree with watching it on a large format but the 3D was just downright distracting in that movie I enjoyed the film much more watching it in 2D after having first watched it in IMAX3D It just felt deeper as a picture without having to be forced to focus on a specific focal point The entire background of the movie was lost in fuzziness having to watch it in 3D I just still dont see why people pay the price to watch stuff in 3D Its gimmicky and it takes away from the overall movie
2015-05-07 18:31:39,13,0,13,Focus,I think people put way too much focus on those contracts They arent forced to make the exact number of movies on someones contract Actors renegotiate contracts Actors leave projects theyre contracted for Movies get scrapped and changed
2015-05-07 18:42:28,1,0,1,Focus,While it isnt a perfect movie its easy to be convinced by the reddit comments that it was a bad one since its been out long enough that the cool thing is to focus solely on its flaws
2015-05-07 19:10:58,5,0,5,Focus,I cant speak for why other people hate them but personally it physically hurts me to watch 3D movies It may have something to do with my eyesight near sighted I also have astigmatism but I cant for the life of me manage to focus the 3D effects into existence I just end up seeing a bunch of blurry things with a weird depth to them and I end up getting a migraine within minutes
2015-05-07 20:02:23,1,0,1,Focus,Every time theres a cut your eyes have to instantaneously do a lot of extra work to determine where to focus whilst keeping up with the story
2015-05-07 20:37:50,7,0,7,Focus,except asian trailer focused on ken wasabe instead of Cranston
2015-05-07 20:38:19,0,0,0,Focus,Nah not joking I thought they did a bang up job political thriller wise given the story material To focus on that aspect of hydra was well done
2015-05-07 21:14:55,1,0,1,Focus,Maybe because all the interviewers wont shut up about the amount of violence in his films Id be a douche too if people keep focusing on the violent parts of the film and not about the film itself

2015-05-08 02:18:22,9,0,9,Focus,Goblet of Fire is fucking great Has a lot of the methodical drama and narrative unfolding many scenes dedicated to dialogue and drama but throughout the entire film the action and spectacle is always bumped up to 11 I always felt GoF was the pinnacle of the series The lighthearted and beautiful magical atmosphere of the world which Philosophers Stone focused on mixed with the the danger of the wizarding world established in CoS plus the a major expansion on lore drama and mystery that PoA delved into For me it all came together at its peak in GoF
2015-05-08 02:28:09,19,0,19,Focus,For me it was the shot of the father picking them both up and spinning them around like he did with Girl A in the beginning Combine that with the focus on them holding hands liking the same dress looking similar and Girl B leaving with only her mother visible and it sets up the idea that there is a connection between all these people If it had just been some random shots I probably wouldnt have guessed it but since the focus is on telling the story visually you can assume those details are intentional and important

2015-05-09 04:53:18,1,0,1,Focus,I actually thought that was done intentionally by Whedon because of how in Avengers 1 and other superhero movies not just limited to Marvel the climax involves widespread civilian death and destruction and yet the human toll doesnt get recognized as much by the plot Whereas in AoU the Avengers seem preoccupied with saving civilians including Hulks feelings after what happened in singular focus on stopping the villain at all costs that weve seen recently
2015-05-09 04:55:14,10,0,10,Focus,Age of Ultron was a lot more focused its paced fairly consistently unlike ASM 2 which had some bits that were very meandering and for all the set up that was there for future films it still had a story in it that had a beginning a middle and an end Although it wasnt completely self contained AOU still had its own main plotline that was completely resolved by the end of the film Also the villain was much better in AOU than ASM2

2015-05-11 01:49:32,0,0,0,Focus,I wouldnt really say Id recognize it as really good Id say while I didnt really like it much I think a lot of that was due to overhyping and I was too focused on the movie being oveerrated and Id honestly say it was more of a movie that you can recognize isnt a masterpiece but you can still enjoy Much more so then the other way around as the prompt was asking for
2015-05-11 02:55:07,1,0,1,Focus,Ive got to agree with my fellow commentators here Anime does have a lot of superheroes and supernatural stuff going on But the really great ones worth watching use a bit of magic to symbolize something much more complex in order to make it easier to understand If you havent check out Death Note and Akira The story has supernatural elements but the focus is on people
2015-05-11 03:08:39,1,0,1,Focus,Thats what Im thinking The US profit being the main focus is slowly shifting as people realise they can make more in Asia than USA or EU All I want is it to be successful
2015-05-11 03:36:20,0,0,0,Focus,In my opinion theyll always focus the bulk of their efforts on The Avengers and use any side films like Black Panther simply as blank checks I doubt anyone other than the most diehard fans even care about heroes that arent captain hulk thor iron man hawkeye and Scar Jo Slap Marvel on the poster say it connects to The Avengers somehow and youve got yourself a blockbuster
2015-05-11 04:55:57,1,0,1,Focus,Its not similar to Cowboy Bebop besides being futuristic They both explore different themes and have different focuses
2015-05-11 06:19:42,1,0,1,Focus,To some extent simply because food is a common part of everyday life so its difficult to avoid it Also because Japanese culture has more connotations of wholesomeness and comfortable hominess of a fresh meal prepared by hand kind of more like 1950sera America Mostly though I think youre just suffering from confirmation bias food preparation is really not that prevalent of a trope in anime Not unless you watch an anime that is specifically focused on food Shokugeki no Souma Koufuku Graffiti for example
2015-05-11 09:34:35,12,0,12,Focus,Not to mention the part where multiple time throughout the film Batemans own colleagues get him mixed up with other people Theyre so selfabsorbed and artificial that ones name isnt attached to a face but rather to a persona built from status and appearances hence the focus on suits business cards and reservations
2015-05-11 09:47:04,2,0,2,Focus,A fascinating movie would be something like Wolf of Wall Street but focused on a woman basically figuring out how to get wealthy men to pay her off destroy their lives marry and quickly divorce billionaires etc
2015-05-11 10:25:50,1,0,1,Focus,I was really annoyed with these when I still read Marvel comics They spread some bigger stories and some times even smaller good ones between several different titles I wouldve had to buy SpiderMan then to follow what happened after his cliffhanger in Fantasy Four and go from that to buy Hulk and with some bigger stories it went on and on and on I did not have the money and I did not like the other characters as much Even if the story continued in the other comic the focus wouldve been more in the titular character of the continuing comic
2015-05-11 10:39:03,6,0,6,Focus,I like the point about the small focus The fate of the human race or even a nation is a pretty abstract concept and in having heroes fight for so many people it can be difficult to get the audience to care about any person theyre saving It also leads to the weird why is the death of millions glossed over situations in Superman The Avengers etc
2015-05-11 12:36:39,2,0,2,Focus,Interstellar focused way more on story In Gravity all we got were a few throw away character beats The only story was things kept going wrong and Sandra had to escape
2015-05-11 12:38:37,1,0,1,Focus,Me too its half of the reason I hated the movie the other half being the meandering unfocused plot I felt American Psycho and Wall Street had explored much more interesting sides to this exact same world than Look at how much coke and hookers we were geting through on a weekly basis werent we the shit

2015-05-11 15:10:15,6,0,6,Focus,I guess I notice these things as I am interested in the moving making process I always wonder why the director made this shot over another or why is this camera focusing on this object background etc Product placement is not inherently bad but IMO when it is the driving force for several shots there is a problem Everyone views movies differently and I think many people get so wrapped up in the movie they dont notice or dont care which again there is nothing wrong with
2015-05-11 15:10:39,-6,0,-6,Focus,Yes it did Scenes literally stopped to focus on it It kills the momentum and atmosphere of a scene of carnage when a perfectly clean unscathed AUDI happens to survive the chaos
2015-05-11 15:16:58,-35,0,-35,Focus,Yeah instead of focusing on important things like sustainable energy greenhouse gasses petro chemicals war etc we should all waste our time watching movies that cost hundreds of millions to produce and making sure the studios keep spending money opulently
2015-05-11 15:23:52,5,0,5,Focus,No youre right it is definitely suggesting a larger problem What I was trying to say is that being able to focus on this one kid stopped me from being distracted by the presence of a message
2015-05-11 15:45:50,2,0,2,Focus,It was used brilliantly in Waynes World May have been the sequel Sometimes its annoying because it can make the suspension of disbelief difficult like a techfocussed movie where the Sony logo is repeatedly made prominent but sometimes it can kind of add to it like vintage ads or products being featured in movies set in say the 50s60s
2015-05-11 15:48:58,4,0,4,Focus,The reason its done poorly is because the cameras focus on them for several seconds or even name drop them and the products are never shown to be less than perfect eg clean undamaged AUDI amongst a destroyed street
2015-05-11 15:53:55,6,0,6,Focus,I personally think its better they use real brands The focused on Banners headphones because it was a key part of the scene listening to the music and it makes sense he wears that brand I dont mind them showing the product because it doesnt affect me as a viewer Theyre clearly displaying the brand but I dont see how thats a problem
2015-05-11 16:02:13,10,0,10,Focus,I saw Birdman recently as well and there is a couple of 3 second shots that subtlety focused on a sticky note on the mirror with a quote A thing is a thing not what is said of that thing This exemplifies the theme of the movie with only taking a few seconds of screen time These are the things that pop out of my mind the director made a conscious effort to draw the audiences attention to that object for a reason Now imagine if right there instead there was a Nike logo or apple logo What would you naturally infer about the purpose of that shot did it have artistic reasons or simply was it cash in I cringe when I see this stuff as it makes the movie feel plastic or a sell out Basically profit is more important that immersion or artistic statements
2015-05-11 16:11:48,2,0,2,Focus,Selvig was silly Gotta agree That one scene was completely out of place in the movie I think they could have found other ways to bring this threat more into focus for the Avengers Maybe Odin calls Thors cell and says holy crap these stones are all up in our shit I mean there are so many options vision quest seemed silly For all I know its ripped right out of the comics though
2015-05-11 16:48:18,1,0,1,Focus,See I didnt notice any product placement because Im not actively looking for it The only one I noticed was the Beats headphone but thats only because of the lingering shot and because the focus of the tension is on Banner at that moment who just got pulled out of the Hulk by Black Widow
2015-05-11 16:57:35,0,0,0,Focus,gt One shot literally begins by focusing on Banners ear as his hands conveniently are not covering the Beats by Dre logo of his headphones A 2 second focus on his headphones

2015-05-11 18:47:17,1,0,1,Focus,I personally find the postmovie discussion to be an integral part of the cinema experience While I love movies in a rather cruel twist of fate the universe saw fit to imbue me with an attention span about as consistent and longlived as a butterflys flight plan which usually causes me to lose focus and feel no connection to the narrative or plot However for some reason knowing that Ill be discussing a movie to death once its over forces me to pay attention which results in greater enjoyment on my part  I know thats not how everyone enjoys movies but for me socialization is a key ingredient in my enjoyment of a good movie
2015-05-11 18:55:07,2,0,2,Focus,I think some of the trailers could have done betterI think they focused a little to much on the over the top action and not enough on what makes it mad max

2015-05-11 22:32:26,1,0,1,Focus,They arent going to reboot the whole universe Theyre introducing at least 5 new franchises before Infinity War one of which will be a reboot itself Spiderman Not to mention the fact that they already have 3 ongoing TV shows that have already been renewed with more soon to follow Plus the inhumans movie is already scheduled to take place after Infinity War and they put a lot of work setting it up in Agents of Shield If anything theyll just focus on a new batch of characters and put to rest some of the older ones for big events and such
2015-05-11 23:22:56,1,0,1,Focus,Lots of publications cant print the word badass which makes it harder to be quoted which makes it harder to attract new readers BMD is an established brand its the name of the print magazine associated with Alamo Drafthouse and better portrays their focus on film

2015-05-12 00:27:59,3,0,3,Focus,Except Guardians was known to be Marvels riskiest project Disney wasnt sure what kind of movie it should be as they had no previous Guardians films to focus group So we got the movie Gunn wanted to make Raimi Whedon and Abrams have all moaned about studio intrusion Raimi and Whedon have walked away and I doubt Abrams will shoot three Star Wars pictures
2015-05-12 01:40:57,1,0,1,Focus,This gives No Country a great feeling of emptiness when out in the desert while also making it feel eerie and tense when focusing on  Llewelyn being chased by Anton
2015-05-12 02:12:36,1,0,1,Focus,It also sort of bothered me that the movie wasnt really about loneliness its a social satire of our dependence on technology People nowadays seemed married to their phones Im writing this on my phone now It shouldve been focused on depression because any point about technology it tried to make either seemed boring or cliche

2015-05-12 04:53:43,1,0,1,Focus,Seriously Because they would have to effectively make two edit and write two films and sooner or later to make a PG13 film you have to give up some concessions be it violence sex drugs language all these things earn points that add up to give the rating That means that parts of the Rrated film get cut out maybe scenes or dialogue but something has to go You cant just make a good Rrated film then go back and edit it to make PG13 Have you never watched an Rrated film that was edited for television Thats basically what you end up with You have to focus on making one coherent film not trying to make two coherent films at the same time Because if you decide to divide focus that is how you turn out two shit products Not to mention the whole spending extra  on effects editing sound voice overs etc so you can have those two films
2015-05-12 04:54:04,5,0,5,Focus,It starts with assembling the four magicians but then for the sake of not spoiling their acts we have to lose focus on them and the role of protagonist switches to Mark Ruffalo We see Mark Ruffalo stressed by his problem in seclusion so he cant be the secret Mastermind Then a lot of flash and gorgeous lights and a revelation which might impress people who cant think back to how it means characters acted contrary to their longterm goals in all the flashbacks I think What the fuck and I see Kurtzman and Orcis name on screen oh that explains it Fuck this movie fuck the dumbest way to tease a sequel with a scene that means nothing Its an ignorant incohesive mess
2015-05-12 05:20:05,1,0,1,Focus,Lol I know right I love Goodfellas not a fan of Departed but the ending scene was amazing Wolf of Wall Street is good but stays a little too focused on the party stuff to be great imo Gangs of New York is decent a bit long but its brutal and dirty in a  great way
2015-05-12 05:58:33,2,0,2,Focus,It felt to me like it wanted to sit in between three genre types It wanted to be a heist thriller and fantasy movie It really couldnt settle on one where it should have settled on one and allowed the others to take a back ground and be flourishes to its main focus

2015-05-12 06:34:55,4,0,4,Focus,Salo I cant recommend it enough for you guys The entire movie is about letting loose and just going crazy Have you seen Project X or 21 and Over Pales in comparison to the absolute debauchery the 4 protagonists or antagonists if you consider the kinds of shennanigans these boys get up to get into It really is just a fun flick that actually makes you stop and think about your future and what its all about all the while trying to remain in the present and just ya know focus on chilling out and partying with your friends
2015-05-12 06:41:40,1,0,1,Focus,watch with headphones on and with subtitles make it hard for you to focus on anything else

2015-05-12 09:43:54,2,0,2,Focus,Im currently reading a few books on film noir and they really help understand the whole movement Because of parody popular conception of the genre if you classify it a genre has focused on aesthetic qualities such as overstylized lighting and detective voice over Those are two important elements but the true defining traits of film noir are more subtle and a lot more interesting

2015-05-12 14:01:52,1,0,1,Focus,Good point And 28 Months Later would be a perfect time period to focus on its just enough time for the true ramifications of the epidemic to take hold and for people to adjust to the situation They should make it a dayinthelife sort of postapocalyptic movie

2015-05-13 14:57:22,14,0,14,Focus,Exactly They act like a femalefocused action film is inherently sexist an idea which itself is sexist creating a paradoxical world of sexism where literally nothing cannot be sexist Its insane circular logic
2015-05-13 14:58:48,0,0,0,Focus,Maybe both groups should try to work together to focus on the actual issues that affect both men and women
2015-05-13 15:47:44,1,0,1,Focus,Oh god I need to watch that fighting in a circle bit like 5 more times When I watched it I was like this is amazing then like omg stop geeking out and focus on whats going on
2015-05-13 15:48:54,8,0,8,Focus,There was a story and it isnt hard to follow It just focused on the visuals more than anything Its still a movie

2015-05-13 16:32:53,52,0,52,Focus,del toro really doesnt go in for that shit his influences are guys like lovecraft who focused on the slow build kind of horror
2015-05-13 17:06:12,1,0,1,Focus,Its tricky The kind of director you are talking about would probably fall more in line with the auteur Kubrick Hitchcock etc And these directors probably resent having a DP around anyway since theyd probably rather shoot it themselves haha Other directors seem to just focus on the actorsshaping the overall project
2015-05-13 17:09:39,22,0,22,Focus,I see theyre focusing on Emilias butt rather than her tits this time
2015-05-13 17:13:25,16,0,16,Focus,I remember when the movie was being marketed they consistently focused on and teased that fight scene and Ryan Goslings intense Wanna fight that got a lot of people hyped up And then they saw the movie and was disappointed Ryans pretty boy face was gussied up It was awesome
2015-05-13 18:26:16,1,0,1,Focus,My friends who love James Bond all get really into that You have that with Star Wars as well I dont think you can say people are watching Star Wars wrong if they focus on the backstory of the Sith empire for example Theres no wrong way of watching movies
2015-05-13 18:26:57,1,0,1,Focus,Also 9 times out of 10 the 3d effect is not going to be very good with films that have a lot of motion in each frame  3d works well with slower motion sequences so things dont go out of focus
2015-05-13 19:49:03,0,0,0,Focus,Logging in from the grave to say that I agree with your female friend I dont believe the ending which constituted all of ten minutes of the movie negated the hour before of pornographic indulgence The viewer is taken through exorbitant scenes of sexual abuse and gratuity Does the camera REALLY focus on this for so long to show how wrong it is Does the average viewer need to see naked womens bodies kept in CLOSETS to understand that the dude is super evil and this whole dynamic is wrong
2015-05-13 20:33:33,1,0,1,Focus,Not a movie but the first season of Broadchurch was the best murder mystery Ive seen in a loooong time Only about 7 or 8 episodes in length The second season is just as good but there is a lot less focus on the mystery side of things than the first season
2015-05-13 20:36:23,1,0,1,Focus,Since the first outbreak of Rage we were unprepared for how fast the virus could spread Within a month the entire island was infected you either ran you hid or you died Major cities were like a petridish where the virus could propagate millions of viable hosts packed together like sardines in a can Infection was so fast it was mere hours between seeing it on a news broadcast to fleeing into the night with screaming infected baying for your blood We thought wed beaten it once before but we were wrong The feeling of losing London all over again was a bitter pill to swallow Those who had survived the nightmare once before came to live it again But we never dreamed it could leave our dead shores and cross to mainland Europe the French authorities were better prepared than us theyd witness the devastation from across the channel They contained the outbreak all seemed under control How ignorant we were we didnt look back to were the virus began Rage was initially used to infect chimps for scientific study we knew this virus could infect other species yet as humans do we focused on ourselves If only we had stopped thinking the virus ended with us we might have stood a chance we could have contained and eradicated Rage But we were too short sighted Rage has no prejudice against species Rage consumes all As Britain burned and the bodies littered the country birds feasted on infected carcasses and carrion gorging on infected flesh Soon they would migrate in search of warmer climate and so Rage would lay its seed in every corner of the globe England fell in 28 Days in 28 Months so did the world
2015-05-13 21:27:10,5,0,5,Focus,The title refers to a specific series from the comicshttpsenwikipediaorgwikiNew_Mutants it may change but its probably a way for people to know what the movie will focus on
2015-05-13 21:40:42,14,0,14,Focus,This is exciting First Class is still my favorite because it at least partly focuses on the young teen aspect A movie that focuses on young mutants coming together to bond and work together sounds exciting and the more they let it be its own thing without a Wolverine or to a lesser extent a CharlesMagneto storyline the better
2015-05-13 22:31:12,2,0,2,Focus,Marc Webb however was a very good choice considering they wanted to focus on the relationship of the two main leads which was brilliant in both films

2015-05-14 00:25:54,2,0,2,Focus,This whole marvel movie thing is starting to get kind of ridiculous Infinity Stones An alien falling in love with a personified Death And from Feiges recent comment about never going darker than Avengers 2 its seriously turning from a half adult half childish line of moviesinto a whole toddlerfocused franchise
2015-05-14 01:09:48,33,0,33,Focus,Too many feminists focused on criticisng Black Widow for not being All That And Everything when the real problem is that there should have been more women present complementing Black Widow the way Captain America complements Iron Man who complements Bruce Banner etc
2015-05-14 01:26:51,2,0,2,Focus,It speaks more for the person than the movie if theyre unable to maintain focus on a movie simply because someone isnt speaking
2015-05-14 01:26:57,1,0,1,Focus,I kinda agree but at this point I dont mind them letting them finish Wolverine as a character We know that Hugh Jackman only has a few more movies and it would be really random to change the formula now with Wolverine still there I have a decent amount of confidence that Wolverine isnt going to be center stage postJackman if they even continue the character at all so I dont mind waiting just a bit longer for them to really focus on other characters
2015-05-14 02:04:28,6,0,6,Focus,I think they both work With Whiplash he is surrounded by non stop words while his only focus is the drums despite the endless noise around him With Her Phoenix is alone despite being surrounded by noise communication and the outside world Her is about loneliness and Whiplash is about obsession I think those posters frame each concept really well
2015-05-14 02:14:38,1,0,1,Focus,I like that you made this thread I watched schmoes for a bit awhile back and just thought how are these guys so popular with such a shitty set up and not even a focused review show so I just altogether stopped watching them As for jeremy I actually watch him cause I find his reviews somewhat entertaining but most of his opinions really stupid its just opinions no need to be so shitty for someone thinking differently I do enjoy also when he covers reveals on upcoming stuff or spoiler talks I watched one movie fight podcast and was pretty much done with those guys afterwards

2015-05-14 03:55:41,1,0,1,Focus,I agree I think it is made fairly clear that Nathan knew what was going to happen  just not when This is especially made clear that this was the intention when Nathan says AI will think of humans as upright apes and comparable to how we think of fossils Brilliant writing that is meant to show Garlands point with focus and clarity
2015-05-14 04:10:29,1,0,1,Focus,Pixar imo has always put out the better quality films their work was more 3d cartoon and style and story where dreamworks imo was  lacking in those areas and seemed to be focused more on branding and appeal to children
2015-05-14 12:24:33,7,0,7,Focus,Theres a lot of places where the film could have been better Thats one of them The general lack of development for the members of the titular First Class was saddening especially with Angel Salvador becoming a snarling mute ninny once she joined Magneto I feel like the film was a smushingtogether of two concepts one for a XavierMagneto origin film I know that the film grew out of a planned Origins Magneto film and the other for a proper First Class film that focused mostly on the students themselves
2015-05-14 14:30:34,2,0,2,Focus,Nothing is impossible but they did say the point of this movie was to focus on the soldiers The creators implied that that there would be no major forceusing characters in this story at Celebration so I wouldnt count it as likely
2015-05-14 15:00:07,2,0,2,Focus,Most are mainly because they portray Americans as the eventual heroes fighting some tyrannical force Look at  American Sniper Some saw it as a movie about a war hero gunned down before his time after performing numerous honorable actions overseas On the other end some people saw it as ninety minutes worth of bragging based on dubious morality and a trigger happy soldier But no matter what his character in the movie was portrayed as above board and justified in his actions American movies show what war is like for us They dont show what happened to native civilians when we invaded Iraq or Afghanistan It doesnt show what happens when we pull out of a nation Even movies that show war in a more brutal light focus on the hardships of our soldiers and how their our cause is just
2015-05-14 15:05:15,29,0,29,Focus,Im fine with it being called a feminist movie if that label and the movie isnt equated with men v women when its really more women defying a patriarchal world I worry about the movie being singled out or championed as a feminist movie when it may be better off to focus on what it got right and how well it has been received to better normalise well written female characters in Hollywood blockbusters
2015-05-14 15:37:12,1,0,1,Focus,That was the point though  he focused on the money disregarding everything else Im not saying that this was a happy ending for all of them Just that he himself got what he wanted since the beginning  money for his family
2015-05-14 15:55:56,2,0,2,Focus,People like to complain that Wolverine was the main character of DoFP again even though he really wasnt Much like First Class this movie focuses much more on Charles Erik and Raven and in my opinion really develops their characters especially Charles Its why Days of Future Past is easily my favourite comic book movie
2015-05-14 16:17:49,18,0,18,Focus,Im not sure I like the idea of having another film focused on Max and Furiosa not that I didnt like the character its just that Max should go off to get involved in another persons story Hes a drifter he doesnt stick around
2015-05-14 17:06:00,1,0,1,Focus,gt Im not sure I like the idea of having another film focused on Max and Furiosa
2015-05-14 19:02:39,7,0,7,Focus,Fucking idiots out of touch with what the story is about  Aside from the first film none of the stories were really Maxs tale  Road Warrior started off about Max but just to get the audience familiar with the setting  Thunderdome was an even bigger departure  I imagine this film will be about the same thing  a wonderer who gets caught between two rival sides and aides one who the story is really focused on while fighting the other  Its just a different version of the Man with No Name films that Eastwood did fistful good bad ugly etc and you know what  They have been great  There is a simple solution to all of this dont see the movie and continue living shallow closed minded lives
2015-05-14 20:30:23,10,0,10,Focus,Grave Of The Fireflies for sure Though the second time I watched Interstellar I felt like my brain focused more on the undertones of existential horror a Nolan staple of course hidden inside the arty blockbuster and like most of his films if you really start thinking about the implications of the events in the film its genuinely frightening
2015-05-14 20:42:01,1,0,1,Focus,Yeah I dont really get all the Halle Barry hate There is so much else glaringly wrong with the movie to focus on
2015-05-14 21:18:58,-1,0,-1,Focus,Wow Way to fucking condescend Ive read plenty of history books thank you Yeah sure crusades inquisition wars etc etc etc The Holocaust is different never before or since had murder been institutionalized in such a cruelly efficient and focused fashion I also never said it wasnt fine to make a movie about it I simply found the disparity between the attempt at verisimilitude in the film and the reality of the event to be too great to take seriously Hence I was unmoved by the film
2015-05-14 22:35:31,2,0,2,Focus,I cant remember being this stressed out and anxious watching a film in a long time I credit that to the overall lack of CGI and focus on practical stuntwork Though wed all seen it in the trailer that shot of Max on the stick sailing over as the explosion went off was fucking amazing
2015-05-14 23:01:55,1,0,1,Focus,Trust with Clive Owen I think and it was made by David Schwimmer Fucking depressing but it also gives you inside on how to treat victims of abuse imo Focus on providing for the victim not destroying the perpetrator
2015-05-14 23:10:38,1,0,1,Focus,Thats good to hear I hope they make those the focus of the movie then
2015-05-14 23:22:33,3,0,3,Focus,Charlize Theron was a much better character then MAx the film even focused on her more Goes to show that an action movie with a female lead can be a sucess
2015-05-15 00:55:32,1,0,1,Focus,Maybe instead they could focus on more female villains Id imagine they could introduce a female Carnage for example without too much trouble I mean female heroes are great and all but when the screen is that cluttered its often the bad guy that steals the show Ie Loki
2015-05-15 01:51:54,1,0,1,Focus,It really doesnt matter theres still a heavy focus on Max
2015-05-15 02:55:05,1,0,1,Focus,Watching the originals might help you get a better understanding of the world in these movies but plot wise it isnt a necessity  No outright sexual nudity that I can remember minus one quick sequence sort of focusing on some of the female characters They arent naked just not a lot of clothing  The R rating is more for the violence not sexual content
2015-05-15 03:09:44,4,0,4,Focus,I really wish I lived near an Alamo Drafthouse  There is a Movie Tavern about 40 minutes away and its pretty nice but there isnt near amount of focus on movie etiquette that the Drafthouse is famous for
2015-05-15 03:11:34,1,0,1,Focus,yes definitely a more focused movie and less of a crowd movie even with all the explosions and awesome
2015-05-15 03:54:45,1,0,1,Focus,It is actually a great kids movie The ending shows you that you should focus on good things in your life since bad things happen all the time
2015-05-15 03:55:57,9,0,9,Focus,Id rather have a good actor playing him Peter Parker is supposed to be a teenager Makes more sense to me than casting some twenty year old and hoping he doesnt look too old There seems to be a good amount of support for Asa playing him and why not Someone who is actually a teenager AND is a talented actor Hope you dont focus so much on looks in your everyday life
2015-05-15 04:09:40,16,0,16,Focus,There are strong feminist themes in Fury Road but to call it propaganda is a disservice to the entirety of the film Propaganda tend to focus on one thing only leaving the rest unpolished or unexplored
2015-05-15 04:40:03,1,0,1,Focus,I think you and I focused on different things in the movie I honestly couldnt stop thinking about Emily Ratajkowskis in Amys words Giant cum on me tits
2015-05-15 05:56:06,8,0,8,Focus,The movie focuses on a really large and interesting world without investing itself in a single main character  I can see the argument that there was little character development or investment but thats probably just the product of juggling such a huge array of characters and personalities and the fact that the movie is pretty much paced as one long chase sequence  Its loud obnoxious and violent but it elevates loud obnoxious and violent to an artform
2015-05-15 07:45:49,10,0,10,Focus,I dont feel like any of the male characters were as fleshed out as Furiosa really least of all Mad Max The movie wasnt really characterfocused on the whole which is fine
2015-05-15 09:11:36,27,0,27,Focus,I hear you and I agree with most of what you said but here are some of the reasons why I find it to be a feminist text maybe they could convince you I dont think that the Five Wives not getting much development excludes the film from being feminist Although I do think each has agency and gets a brief moment to shine Given the frantic pace of the whole thing and its focus on MaxFuriousa I think that is an accomplishment in and of itself
2015-05-15 13:27:30,6,0,6,Focus,I was already so excited for Fury Road but now that youre comparing it to Whiplash OH MY GOD  I remember watching Whiplash and I was tense and so focused the entire time and finally when the movie ended I felt like I could breathe
2015-05-15 14:43:45,1,0,1,Focus,I think youre just missing the dynamic between the marketing of the film and the film itself The trailer set up the film as a sort of Scott Peterson situation  a woman goes missing and progressively the husband is scrutinized as a suspect Under that harsh light small character flaws and secrets become major points of suspicion Or maybe he really did it Its not a romantic comedy or an action movie Everyone going into it knew it was a characterdriven drama but not what direction it would take Ben Affleck is much better known than Rosamund Pike A lot of people probably wouldnt have known how good an actor she is And the trailer really feeds off of the typical media presentation of these kinds of realworld situations It sets you up to focus completely on Afflecks character
2015-05-15 14:49:51,10,0,10,Focus,I saw the first for the first time last night Loved it its atmosphere reminded me a ton of The Warriors The pacing also didnt bother me because lowbudget movies back then always seemed to have weird pacing  I actually thought that was part of its charm One of my complaints though was the end where they seem to focus more on killing the lesser gang member instead of the head honcho Switch their death scenes and I think it works a lot better
2015-05-15 15:00:32,12,0,12,Focus,My husband is totally obsessed with the FampF franchise because of the carshes a total gearhead He brought me along to the last film the one that came out a few years ago and walking out of it I was actually mad Ill sit through dumb movies for him whatever but this movie was BAD The dialogue was abysmal the action felt cheap and the plot was nonsensical I was mad because it was almost 2 hours and never once was I invested It could have been better but instead they focused on making explosions instead of making the dialogue not laughable
2015-05-15 15:13:04,1,0,1,Focus,I didnt watch a whole lot of it on account of having already seen the three movies but I think they make it focus mainly on Bilbo and the dwarves and cut out a LOT of the battle of Five Armies I didnt think the Hobbit movies were terribly bad Sure they werent LoTR but I still enjoyed them immensely Well not Desolation but the others were nice
2015-05-15 17:18:38,1,0,1,Focus,You mean Ford Focus
2015-05-15 17:30:22,3,0,3,Focus,Im not arguing against the feat that Marvel have pulled off Though I would argue that actually AoS doesnt need to be so beholden to the MCU In fact the back half of AoS has been entirely too busy and oddly focused because its trying to function as its own thing while also serving the movie masters
2015-05-15 18:31:37,2,0,2,Focus,No he didnt they even make it explicitly clear that he is Iron Man with or without the suit which leads into him removing his chest reactor He blows up the suits as a means to show Pepper that he is going to spend less time obsessively tinkering in the lab to focus more on their relationship
2015-05-15 18:43:40,15,0,15,Focus,What they did was put all the strengths and weakness of each character on the screen  They never got stronger or weaker for the plot  It was the character from start to finish  Thats something that never happens in these movies and thats why the action was so great in Winter Solider I cannot wait for them to apply that laser focus on Tony Stark and Peter Parker
2015-05-15 18:50:42,1,0,1,Focus,I feel like a lot of people will be looking really hard for him Taking away focus from the movie itself
2015-05-15 19:44:55,3,0,3,Focus,Notice the subtlety of the blocking and camerawork when Thor lifts Tony by the fucking throat because hes so angry at him I dont blame you for not putting two and two together Its only the first two acts of the film that focus on it
2015-05-15 19:50:09,1,0,1,Focus,Potential was the wrong word I suppose More like focus i guess It wasnt about being cute or having plushies available or anything that i feel like half the animated features that come out today have to meet a quota on
2015-05-15 20:15:59,2,0,2,Focus,Pretty much By X I mean almost any balanced measurement of movie enjoyment  I can see action movies that could do character development but they would have no where near as much action I could see them having better action but barely and it would need to be the primary focus of the movie but no where near the symbolism or plot depth
2015-05-15 20:26:11,8,0,8,Focus,Whats great about Mad Max is that it has a completely singular focus and executes on it perfectly Theres no added complexity or distraction Few universes and stories have that liberty
2015-05-15 21:01:58,0,0,0,Focus,The entire movie was just garbage Just marvel no one ever dies except this one guy we spent 15 minutes developing a cliche backstory for shlock too busy setting up other movies to even focus on their own shittily made production Great you have lotsa bad looking CG Oh awesome more witty quips Love how Ultrons METAL mouth moved as though it had human lips and he had teeth Only in a few scenes though cause that makes sense
2015-05-15 21:21:39,7,0,7,Focus,gt Whedon wanted to cut the pool scene completely and focus more on Hawkeyes family relationship

2015-05-16 00:07:24,1,0,1,Focus,Just out of curiosity do you know of any biopics that focus on the scientist of this historical event I cant think of any I couldnt imagine the psychological damage that came from creating this death machine
2015-05-16 00:43:28,0,0,0,Focus,Youve never been dead huh You just fill in the parts most of it is just a blur and the roar of the ocean like listening to a giant seashell You focus on such small things they turn into creations as delicate deep and meaningful as the cosmos
2015-05-16 00:49:50,1,0,1,Focus,I like how he fought Max just to get his guitar back and then went right back to playing Dude didnt even want to fight Max he just wanted his guitar back so he could rock out some more He didnt seem to care about or even notice the absolutely bonkers shit happening around him Just 100 focused on shredding m __ m
2015-05-16 01:36:29,1,0,1,Focus,Honestly Id love to see a movie where Max is the focus Dont get me wrong I thought this one was a cinema masterpiece but Max felt like a supporting character
2015-05-16 02:35:24,1,0,1,Focus,I really hope this doesnt happen because I want the next one to focus on Max I get that hes typically a guy who just happens to find himself surrounded by chaos but a story with more focus on him as the main protagonist would be welcome after we just got a big movie that reintroduced him in the midst of someone elses story
2015-05-16 03:29:54,1,0,1,Focus,Haters gonna hate I thought it was well done The whole thing was crafted to be a wild ride and Whedon used a lot of clever tricks to tie disparate characters backstories into elegant transitions through a continuous emotional thread For instance one characters distraught dream would be set directly against another characters waking fears similar in mood but unique in context and yet I believe they still fit together I feel like Whedon was really focused on the flow of this piece and the cohesion he sought was that of what any good ensemble film is going for a balance between individuals and a team I left feeling inspired and although I wouldnt say it was a deep film I would recommend it to my friends
2015-05-16 05:47:44,2,0,2,Focus,Between work and family these days when Im on the treadmill or elliptical is the only time outside of the cinemas where I can focus and watch a movie so I actually watch a lot of stuff on my phone

2015-05-16 07:20:10,5,0,5,Focus,Yes  but the focus of the 6 possibly 79 other films has focused on Jedi and how they have to use the Force to guide their destiny in order to bring balance to the universe  Its going to be interesting to see how they make a bounty hunter important on an intergalactic  scale
2015-05-16 07:45:38,0,0,0,Focus,Its the very reason why I think its soso as a movie All the drawn out scenes of snappy backandforth dialogue that Tarantino came up with couldnt hide the two dimensional characterizations and unfocused storytelling The writing draws so much attention to itself its hard to get invested in the plot I dont care if you can write the quirkiest dialogue ever and make these obnoxious oneliners every 20 seconds if I dont feel for the characters youre not accomplishing much as a storyteller
2015-05-16 07:47:15,3,0,3,Focus,Well they ready announced Rouge One which focuses on a rebel squadron stealing the plans to the Death Star and has been confirmed not to have a heavy Jedi presence
2015-05-16 09:38:18,38,0,38,Focus,Its a great movie because of one main thing all the focus is on storytelling Excellent rhytm throughout The cgi is really good but it is all done in support of the story and thats something I applaud nowadays when  its so easy to get lost with the effects and detail Here they kept their eye on the big picture heh
2015-05-16 10:11:46,8,0,8,Focus,He did get a Vibranium upgrade He fucked up Thor with it before Vision saved him Towards the end Thor Ironman and Vision all focus their energy on him and that fucks up the Vibranium body
2015-05-16 10:32:13,1,0,1,Focus,Yeah the term diagetic really helps to focus in film sound analysis When you realise how painstaking the process of adding sound is its clear that every sound is considered thoughtfully to direct the viewers experience of the film in a variety of ingenious ways
2015-05-16 10:43:43,1,0,1,Focus,imagine its mid chase and he takes off the helmet freeze frame and focus bond music starts and you realize starwars was a ruse for the next bond film well played

2015-05-16 11:05:05,0,0,0,Focus,Do you think if they made a film that was entirely CGI and everything was in focus then we as the audience would be able to shift between planes of depth
2015-05-16 11:35:06,4,0,4,Focus,Ive always found it hard to focus on details in 3D worlds It does certain things amazing though like panoramas of landscapes I loved some of the shots in Prometheus Id be willing to give Max a 3D viewing just for some of the landscape shots
2015-05-16 12:55:47,0,0,0,Focus,Humidity is still gas not liquid And the movie made it a point to show that the aliens were focusing on areas with low rainfall like the Middle East
2015-05-16 13:34:08,1,0,1,Focus,Definitely not The golden age of movies is Well behind us Hollywood seems to have forgotten what makes a good movie The focus of movie makers today is creating a world and witty dialogue The plot is an after thought Not only that but anything original and not formulaic disappears into obscurity
2015-05-16 14:07:42,-2,0,-2,Focus,You dont focus on multiple things at once in real life which is exactly what 3D tries to make you do
2015-05-16 14:44:19,3,0,3,Focus,I just want to see a movie on my local megaplexs biggest screen without having to deal with the eye strain that the constant refocusing causes
2015-05-16 14:45:09,6,0,6,Focus,The problem with 3D is that you have to focus on the same thing the camera is focussing on If I want to check out the scenery but the camera is focused on an actor in the foreground then tough luck
2015-05-16 16:25:23,1,0,1,Focus,Im honestly going to have to rewatch the movie some time I mostly focused on Ava and Caleb and reading some discussion about both Nathan and Kyoko made me realize Ive missed a lot about their motivations and implications
2015-05-16 16:29:27,1,0,1,Focus,Finally saw the movie around lunchtime Its a 710 for me Visual design is the reason to see this on the big screen Tons of wastelandafter the bomb stuff in the movie If they added power armor and super mutants this couldve been a Fallout movie Max himself is pretty much OP act of God after he gets the shackles off No cussing or depressing stuff like looting deadbodies gangrapes cannibalism is detailed in the movie it seemed laser focused on the action It feels like a level in COD 4 where you fight all the way to the end and then have to fight your back to the start of the level The final boss fight was kinda over too quick If the Rage video game was as exciting as the action sequences in this movie it would have sold more Didnt see anything in the Furiosa character that would warrant a spinoff though She comes across as another leader of oppressed people type that Max helps out in the 2nd3rd movies I wish the interceptor was more in the movie also I wish dog was back An earlier poster said it rightChekhovs blood bag lolz
2015-05-16 16:46:45,6,0,6,Focus,To be honest Ive never seen the benefit of 3d Takes me 10 min to focus and see clearly and Ive never seen anything supposedly float before me
2015-05-16 17:11:49,1,0,1,Focus,Hmm thats cool I mean I wonder what caused my perspective and your perspective to differ so much I normally really like these kinds of movies and Im always interested in AI and singularity and stuff like that I just got bored during this movie Maybe it was too short to reach its full potential I feel like it just focused on the wrong things and neglected other parts that seemed important or interesting
2015-05-16 17:15:34,1,0,1,Focus,By being so rich a narcissistic and focusing so much on that I felt like it did romanticize his character but thats just the vibe I got
2015-05-16 17:19:07,1,0,1,Focus,I mean both fury road and the road warrior start out with the focus on max then he decides to team up with a third party and tries to help them with their goals I dont see that as very different honestly the only big change is that his mission is focused mainly around one character in this one instead of the oil colony
2015-05-16 17:31:35,-3,0,-3,Focus,Im reading Mad Max is feminist propaganda and the movie is as much about Charlize Theron as about the title character which is a big change from the previous films not having Max be the focus I hope thats not the case cause we dont need another hero  Anyway what are these dudes so pissed about
2015-05-16 17:34:01,2,0,2,Focus,I watched it directly after Ex Machina Very interesting to see two completely different takes regarding AI It was a solid film but I feel as if the film shouldve solely focused on Chappies humanistic development instead of the bank heist subplot
2015-05-16 17:42:19,-1,0,-1,Focus,Hey read my post right underneath you Id heard Max took a backseat to Charlize Theron that seems really messed up The movies have always focused on Max and his story
2015-05-16 18:00:28,1,0,1,Focus,The characters are what makes Star Wars worth a damn So why not focus on one that is already popular but is also mysterious
2015-05-16 18:04:18,6,0,6,Focus,I thought the action scene in The Avengers on the beached ship was very lacking and unfocused  The camera needed to be 20 out  I lost all spacial awareness
2015-05-16 18:39:18,1,0,1,Focus,I watched it on TV not knowing anything about it and not having heard about it before I only found out later it was directed by M Night Shyamalan I thought it was pretty good he tends to use very personal feeling shots and I think it wouldnt have worked if it was a flashier director and would have been an unlikely movie to be made by directors more focused on drama or suspense
2015-05-16 19:52:14,1,0,1,Focus,In Canada the charge is the same but I hate 3D movies because only a small portion of the screen is ever in focus and it gives me a headache later on
2015-05-16 19:54:18,2,0,2,Focus,Bane and Loki were both henchmen but they drove their movies Hell Darth Vader is a henchman Nothing wrong with that Winter Soldier was the main threat and the focus of the movie
2015-05-16 20:50:53,1,0,1,Focus,I actually saw it in both 3d and 2d and i still saw some distortions while suffering from everything looks tinysyndrome I kept having to focus on a point very close to my face beforethewindow instead of the actual space afterthewindow  many movies make this mistake
2015-05-16 21:03:32,7,0,7,Focus,The most brutal death for me was the explosive crossbow to the chest It was like a Chestburster in midair But I too liked how Miller did not focus on every single gorey death and spared no focus to only killing
2015-05-16 21:54:19,1,0,1,Focus,No it doesnt It simply presents an image with added depth It doesnt suggest for you to look at all the different depth levels at the same time Theyre just there for added depth The film usually still points you to a specific point on screen for you to focus just like in 2D
2015-05-16 21:58:21,2,0,2,Focus,I think 3D graphics are getting better but they just seem to take me out of the movie When Im so used to watching a normal film putting on a 3D makes it harder for me to focus on or feel the experience of the film the same way normal formatting would Plus some of those 3D movies only have 1 or 2 scenes that are worth it
2015-05-16 22:01:54,2,0,2,Focus,You can focus on whatever you want to But just like in 2D sometimes some parts of the image are purposefully out of focus The director wants to point your eyes to a specific spot
2015-05-16 22:12:29,1,0,1,Focus,Im just so over 3d It was great when I was young when youd go to the drive in and get those stupid red and blue glasses and drop some acid and lose your godamn mindbut the way it is nowI have a bunch of kids and we definitely tried to like 3d But somebody always pukes It just always happens somebody pukes and then I have to deal with it My kids like 3d but I dont anymore its a stupid gimmick and honestly sometimes the regular 2d scene on the screen is a bit too busy for me Sometimes I sortve lose focus because theres too much shit to look at In 3d it gets even worse
2015-05-16 22:12:47,1,0,1,Focus,I dont ever have a problem focusing on whatever I want in a 3D image In fact I love doing it in slower scenes with no depth of field effects
2015-05-16 22:43:36,3,0,3,Focus,Both movies are great but Mad Max needs to be seen in theaters more because its so spectacular It has a lot of deep meaning hidden behind its flashy visuals but I will say theyre more related to humanity and modern society than Ex Machina which is much more focused on the future
2015-05-16 23:13:42,2,0,2,Focus,No Watch the more focused movies  GotG and Winter Soldier are my favorites  for character development Watch Age of Ultron for explosions and cool scenes
2015-05-16 23:30:10,1,0,1,Focus,I dont have an issue focusing on different planes even with a low depth of field except for the thing Im focusing on being blurry feeling unnatural
2015-05-17 00:48:29,2,0,2,Focus,A little bit I love superhero movies but Ive made myself only focus on the ones coming out in the next year Even though Flash is one of my favorite comic book heroes ever it would be absurd to have to be hyped for that from now until it comes out
2015-05-17 00:51:02,48,0,48,Focus,Well I think the best aspect regarding the writing of Imperator Furiosa Therons character is that the movie doesnt bang on about how much of a strong female character she is She doesnt spend every few lines of dialogue cursing or being a smartarse to build herself up as a tough woman Im look at you Michelle Rodriguez and spends about two minutes coldly lamenting her tragic past Overall shes just simply a badass character from beginning to end and they didnt feel the need to develop her into one They focused on developing the wives instead
2015-05-17 01:27:09,0,0,0,Focus,I actually have a problem with the robot acting SPOILERS Ava is supposed to be true AI but it seems like they focused on the content of her responses not the quality When theyre in a conversation shes showing selfawareness and all of that but when she speaks she doesnt sound like a human  she answers in a very mechanical way She would pass the Turing Test if he was talking to her via text chat but when we actually hear her talk although her answers are very humanistic in what she says I didnt feel they were humanistic in how she said them She sounded like a classical human actress trying to portray a robot
2015-05-17 01:59:57,1,0,1,Focus,Ive heard this argument before and I disagree with it Im going to focus on the 2 most talked about points where people say he had to have had a plan
2015-05-17 02:51:46,7,0,7,Focus,Right I know But Im saying that Hardy still plays the titular character that the franchise will focus upon Id be surprised if Furiosa is present at all in a sequel
2015-05-17 03:03:35,1,0,1,Focus,Nah Check out the speed racer movie They used special multi lens cameras to keep the whole shot in focus it just comes out distracting
2015-05-17 03:22:32,5,0,5,Focus,You know what would be bad ass A Mad Max animated series It could be called The Wasteland and instead of focusing on Max it could further develop the larger universe following the separate but parallel stories of major and minor characters from all four movies
2015-05-17 05:50:53,4,0,4,Focus,There was a SouthPark episode made about 15 years ago which addresses this exact issue It even focuses on Lucas Its great
2015-05-17 07:17:49,1,0,1,Focus,I can only vouch for it in 2D others on here have said 3D makes it darker and harder to focusunderstand whats going Id go with 2D to be honest 3D is too gimmicky for me and you wont want to miss any of the action
2015-05-17 08:50:38,3,0,3,Focus,I wouldnt even say a clear look It was pretty fuzzy because the camera shot was trying to focus while being zoomed in looking down and almost 100 meters away
2015-05-17 12:22:10,1,0,1,Focus,Its so ridiculous that its good If you need logical explanation to everything you will not like this movie But if you can let go some details and focus on the action you will enjoy the hell out of it
2015-05-17 12:48:14,1,0,1,Focus,SciFi movies like Cargo more slasher horrors that dont take itself too seriously comedies that are more focused around funny characters and their misfortunes instead of asshole characters and their horrible humour
2015-05-17 12:54:10,1,0,1,Focus,I saw it in 3D since that was the only option available to me I typically avoid 3D but after reading Millers interview where he said they made it buttery smooth I figured Id give it a chance Really easy to focus on for me only a few parts where debris were flying out rapidly which made my vision blur
2015-05-17 13:09:36,1,0,1,Focus,Ive seen all of them when I was about ten or eleven I liked it more back then but mostly because of the toys and the action I didnt focus much on the plot Its just not my thing
2015-05-17 14:29:20,2,0,2,Focus,Why I thought it was noteworthy that Furiosas title was Imperator Furiosa Imperator from the latin approximately commander eventually resulted in the word emperor While that title might have just referred to her position as the driver of the War Rig I also wondered if that meant at the end that having killed Immortan Joe The People Eater and the Bullet Farmer Furiosa was meant to represent the start of the next rise of civilization  a benign empire focused on growth rebuilding and peace
2015-05-17 14:32:31,3,0,3,Focus,seriously watching the avengers or any of the iron mans is such a chore hes turned every scene into a completely predictable overly choreographed thing filled with beats you see coming a mile away something serious  sarcastic reaction  quick quip  action its like hes purposefully trying to create his own cliche watching The Dark Knight after any of the Marvel films is such a delight I just wish they followed the same formula as Cap 2 it had the right amount of intensity and actually focussed on the fact that hes a superhero all the marvel films do is convince me that these people are fucking idiots who simply dont deserve the powers they have
2015-05-17 14:32:42,12,0,12,Focus,Too many people focus on plot and fail to realize that is merely one aspect of a film Look outside of the Hollywood system and you will see that a movie doesnt have to have a plot to drive the movie forward
2015-05-17 14:34:20,1,0,1,Focus,Am I wrong in thinking this character didnt have eyes I thought he was blinded because his only focus was on the battle music
2015-05-17 15:14:09,2,0,2,Focus,How do you have such a steady hand Im trying to focus not to let the letters change shape just taking notes
2015-05-17 15:18:02,11,0,11,Focus,Mainstream viewers focus on plot because its more of an escape for them a thrill ride where they get to find out what happened  Its less about film as an interesting medium or vehicle for meaning
2015-05-17 16:09:35,1,0,1,Focus,aquaman and flash will only be cameos most of it is focused on batman superman and wonder woman lex is the mastermind behind it all doomsday will be luthors muscle which will probably backfire and superman might die which will form the JL later or the statue we see in the trailer
2015-05-17 16:13:07,1,0,1,Focus,Instead of focusing on the action sequences or gender roles or whether it was a good movie or bad I think we Should focus on the message of the movie While I was watching the movie it felt so real like either this was currently happening outside or its about to happen or it has and I think miller portrayed that really well The movie mad sense and it felt super realistic I guess the people didnt like it didnt like the realness or truth behind it
2015-05-17 16:39:10,2,0,2,Focus,His suits were all weak and easy to destroy because he was obsessed with making them left and right He was cranking them out so quickly that he wasnt focused on making them perfect
2015-05-17 16:41:25,2,0,2,Focus,MASH I think it was one of those things that worked with the context of Vietnam war fatigue but now it just comes of as cornball and sophomoric But honestly I have never seen any Altman movie that didnt seem to me to be a sloppy unfocused mess
2015-05-17 17:54:35,14,0,14,Focus,I thought about that but in The Aviator he was more focused on building and then suffering an eventual decline into mental illness whereas the three I listed have DiCaprio enjoying his illgotten wealth in increasingly depraved ways
2015-05-17 18:25:43,13,0,13,Focus,Yes The movie didnt seem to know what it wanted to be Did it want to be America fuck yeah Lets Kell some terrorists or did it want to delve into PTSD It did a terrible job presenting mental health In most cases PTSD isnt black or white and solved over night like the movie portrayed I wish the focus of the movie was on his mental health and family relationships because those were its strongest scenes
2015-05-17 18:29:55,1,0,1,Focus,Its good Jessica Chastain is amazing in it I hope that guy focuses on her acting along with her hotness
2015-05-17 18:31:57,0,0,0,Focus,Here is a god damn gorgeous bit of cinematography Camera angles and shots a person fucking dreams of Now lets be the dumbest fucking editor in the history of the medium and piss away dozens of beautiful shots by flashing them on screen for mere moments and focus on the nonsensical shit story
2015-05-17 18:32:20,5,0,5,Focus,Its unfortunate that in discussions between feminists and critics the discourse is almost inevitably focused on whether or not systems of oppression against women exist and thus its less frequently brought up that the fact that men also suffer as a result of a patriarchal society is also central to modern feminist ideas All gender stereotypes are harmful and Nux and the warboys are a powerful depiction of how this affects men Exploited utterly by Immortan Joe theyre reduced to beings of pure violence bereft of any kind of feeling other than the ambition to die gloriously The warboys spray paint their mouths chrome before they die to more closely resemble their warchiefs other machines of war They are nothing more than tools to Joe see his line of Mediocre when Nux pledging his life to Joes cause stumbles as much as the wives are his property Its a powerful parallel to how gender norms work to dehumanise men and women men as powerful unfeeling defined by success women as weak objects defined by their appearance
2015-05-17 18:43:46,1,0,1,Focus,I liked it when I was a teenager My friends and I would just get super high on whatever and watch it great time Now even on drugs cant finish it Have you watched Where the Buffalo Roam Bill Murray as Hunter Not so focused on drugs just his journalism and crazy antics
2015-05-17 18:48:20,3,0,3,Focus,gt  a benign empire focused on growth rebuilding and peace
2015-05-17 19:50:27,20,0,20,Focus,There isnt really a catagory for it up there but I recommend the King and the Clown as well Its a historical drama about court performers who get caught up performing for a mentally unhinged and violent king It focusses on the friendship between the two main jesters and the friction that comes from the kings infatuation with the more effeminate of the pair Gonggil while his friend and their fellow performers start to buckle under the pressure
2015-05-17 19:58:01,2,0,2,Focus,For all intensive purposes American Sniper did achieve what I wanted to see in this movie and it is a stirling character piece The problem is Clint Eastwoods film making cuts corners so people focus on that and not the story of a man who went to combat claimed to kill 300 people and then came home to the ire of the American people who discovered what a horrible sham the Iraq war was
2015-05-17 20:37:57,8,0,8,Focus,The car crash is criticized pretty regularly I think because a lot of people are like Why is he walking away Why does he care about the band He was just in a crash Having been in a car crash though not nearly as bad and having my own share of brain injuries I can say that the mind focuses on strange things after accidents like that I thought the scene was pretty great and realistic myself and it would probably have been less realistic if he was thinking more clearly
2015-05-17 21:49:37,1,0,1,Focus,I was so focused on seeing it in Comedy
2015-05-17 22:20:18,1,0,1,Focus,I wanted to like it I knew there was something in there worth thinking about but Christ it was so long and poorly paced It was a real struggle to finish it and keep focused on it
2015-05-17 22:36:38,3,0,3,Focus,There were a few things about it I didnt like Firstly the framing we all  know it was 3D from the outset In most shots the focus of attention was over to one side of the frame This was done to avoid some of the nastier side effects of 3D Made for good 3D patrons not barfing in the isles is a good thing For those watching in 2D it just felt wrong
2015-05-17 22:37:40,5,0,5,Focus,no they are pretending its revolutionary for focusing on fraternal love well the female equivalent the evil han thing doesnt make much sense because of the plot changes that got us the better twist on the sibling relationship
2015-05-17 22:47:45,1,0,1,Focus,You really felt like it focused on Max and Furiosa only There was about 7 main characters
2015-05-17 23:02:32,2,0,2,Focus,Are you asking me if its another genre besides action Id say its an action and adventure film with more focus on the action brilliant action at that
2015-05-17 23:16:52,1,0,1,Focus,Haha its been a while for me too I guess But with the Viewmaster you essentially just get two planes of depth Theres one element in the foreground and it does appear closer to your eye than the background image But theres nothing in the middle ya know Things dont gradually recede out of focus
2015-05-17 23:21:50,-1,0,-1,Focus,Please elaborate and focus on justifying your response by pointing out systems of oppression originating from andor administered by women
2015-05-17 23:33:14,0,0,0,Focus,I wanted more corruption the movie focused too much on the parties and the drugs
2015-05-18 00:43:19,12,0,12,Focus,Honestly he wasnt that bad one of the best parts of the first film actually I just think that Rogen will bring a bit more cultural cache to the role As far as Im concerned Wozniak is the major factor of Apples birth so Rogen being in the spot might allow producers to focus on the duality of the two characters Jobs and Woz more than if a lesser known actor was in the Wozniak role
2015-05-18 01:27:21,2,0,2,Focus,Im with you I think Princess and the Frog did a better job with the feminist message I liked the Randy Newman soundtrack LOVED the villain and the animation was a gorgeous return to classic disney style Disney thinks the reason it was less popular is because it was marketed as a girl movie hence the Tangled and Frozen names for their later princess movies and marketing that focused on Flynn and Sven and Olaf But I think people knew those were girl movies going in and Princess and the Frog didnt take off as much because of the black protagonist Its really hard to prove it though
2015-05-18 01:34:12,1,0,1,Focus,Almost everything is wrong in my opinion They took the movie and made it an semi action flick The focus is different The characters are more flimsy The bad guy had too much convenience I cant be more specific without spoiling anything aside from saying that its like Spiderman web swinging If you dont think about where hes shooting his web and swinging from then your fine Under any sort of scrutiny things start to fall apart
2015-05-18 01:45:17,1,0,1,Focus,There will probably be one scene where we see AntMan actually controlling ants which was in the trailer I doubt there will be much focus on actual insects for the majority of the film
2015-05-18 01:49:46,1,0,1,Focus,Yay Thanks Id also add Sunny though its a really great movie Also A Werewolf Boy made me cry and I thought it was a great movie but maybe thats just because I really like Song Joongki Tazza is a good movie as well And Cart is a recent release and it focuses on female working rights which is pretty cool but not sure if worthy enough to be on the list though pretty recommendable That said thanks again for this list I enjoy Korean movies and I hope everyone can enjoy it as well
2015-05-18 02:59:09,1,0,1,Focus,I loved this film And I didnt expect to Thanks George I did a short review focused on the two main characters if anyone is interested httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvf2CvREbiLUQ

2015-05-18 11:25:43,1,0,1,Focus,One thing I find interesting about this is adding the music the crowd panning the flashing of cameras just in general making everything so epic When in reality you can just watch the product launches on YouTube and they were nothing like this very understated some great jokes but just in general business focused
2015-05-18 11:31:07,0,0,0,Focus,Its held up by many as being so revolutionary due to the more realistic feel as not every line is plot focused Thats more focussing on the semantics though Really I just dont think the dialogue is as good as people hold it up to be There are some good lines but not enough to rave about it the away some people do
2015-05-18 11:49:26,1,0,1,Focus,I didnt think the 3D added anything Maybe itd be more worth it in imax 3D I saw it in a normal theater I found it very distracting when I was trying to look at something the camera wasnt focused on
2015-05-18 12:08:13,1,0,1,Focus,its amazing to me how polarizing even a film about him can be even when it highlights his terrible personal relationships but Ive never heard anything about only wanting business considering all of their early models Apple I and Apple ii were hobbyistconsumer focused

2015-05-18 14:59:38,2,0,2,Focus,I think I read somewhere that Joss didnt leave twitter over the feminism scandal but rather he just left because he felt like it was too much of an attention suck and he wanted to focus his attention of whatever he plans to do next

2015-05-18 16:07:02,-8,0,-8,Focus,The studio system was built by a bunch of white dudes They tend to select stories that focus on white dudes Thats why minorities and women have to sometimes set up their own studios The problem is they dont have access to the same resources as major studios If these studios were more inclusive people wouldnt bitch about not having access to the studio system There are flaws when garbage like Tyler Perry makes huge money because it tells a story that actually revolves around nonwhite people The story about George Lucass enormous battle to get Red Tails made because it was perceived as a black movie is indicative of the problem Or the fact that Hitch couldnt have a white woman or black woman as Will Smiths love interest

2015-05-18 20:14:03,1,0,1,Focus,I like both They have a different focus The American one has a tighter focus less of the side characters and much more on the main characters The lead actor is much better in the American one but in my opinion Chloe Moretz is completely wrong for the vampire role and the Swedish girl is brilliant at it The Swedish one gives you a much broader picture and is generally more subtle I actually prefer the American but most people prefer the Swedish
2015-05-18 20:39:13,0,0,0,Focus,And were supposed to assume from that that the focus is indeed on the lack of female roles over other womens issues I think it is more a case of enjoying movies and reading movie news and coming across this kind of topic and trying to disagree with it

2015-05-18 22:31:28,149,0,149,Focus,I dont want more Furiosa they should focus on Mad Max himself I think
2015-05-18 23:08:50,34,0,34,Focus,Thats the very thing about the Mad Max franchise He is an enigma  Max is our window to his world and thats pretty much the purpose he serves as the main character Furiosa is a fantastic character but there needs to be some mystery to her as well I would honestly prefer sequels that focus on unique characters that belong to the wastelands many religious and cultural factions These characters will come and go as Max does which will serve to add intrigue to Millers world
2015-05-18 23:17:35,19,0,19,Focus,You need to understand that not every film is centered around the plot Fury Road is about the action and the characters interactions with one another That is where Miller chose to focus his efforts and the result is incredible
2015-05-18 23:33:47,2,0,2,Focus,Stardust was great but it wasnt an epic it had a small focus on a few characters and minimal action You dont have an entire army of horseman charging an even bigger army of orcs screaming RIDE FOR RUIN RIDE FOR THE WORLDS ENDING DEEEEEEAAAAATH

2015-05-18 23:54:47,1,0,1,Focus,I think the Orc campaign in Wacraft IIITFT was probably one of the coolest things Blizzard did in Wacraft They recongized that the narrative they wanted to tell in TFT didnt really involve the orcs much so instead of not giving them a campaign or maybe even worse shoehorning them in and giving us a halfassed hammed up plot they just went straight ahead and gave us a completely different campaign with a completely different focus and then even went one set further and made it feel more like Diablo II than Wacraft III
2015-05-19 00:53:41,8,0,8,Focus,Yeah I felt like they wanted to shoehorn in the freshman girl as the protagonist but they still had to keep active all the prominent characters that made the first one so funny Would have pissed a lot of the fans of the first one off if they just ditched the hilarious characters from the first time around Wouldve been fine with her as the main focus but they were all over the place with five different story lines for five characters Felt like a 2 hour long Seinfeld episode
2015-05-19 00:54:24,1,0,1,Focus,Thanks I felt like Im taking crazy pills with everyone liking it so much I feel like for 28 days later and sunshine he must have had the director reining him in He focused more on references to paintings books and how clever he is in his screenplay than actually having a story
2015-05-19 01:47:50,3,0,3,Focus,Thing is though outside of the first movie the focus has never been on Max  Hes more of a device to tell stories in the world  If they actually had an arc for him I feel it would take away from the movies  Hes supposed to be a man that travels around the Waste trying to survive and running into things that could halt his survival  It should stay that way

2015-05-19 03:00:20,1,0,1,Focus,Id argue that the only Mad Max film that focused on the character itself is the first Even then the first film is a jumping off point for Max to be a vessel to guide the viewer through the postapocalyptic world

2015-05-19 08:49:06,76,0,76,Focus,So My husband and I found an old photograph of his grandfather when he was a child He was all decked out in a stylish cowboy costume complete with leather tassels and toy guns My husband told me that his grandfather has always loved westerns and has been what we would call today a fanboy of western movies his entire life Now that hes retired there are old westerns playing on his television from the moment he wakes up until he goes to bed He also has or had quite a few signed photographs of famous western actors in his home as well as memorabilia Something about his grandfathers history struck a cord with me because romanticized western culture never quite makes it into the larger discussion of fan culture I focus on fan culture due to the common connection in contemporary avenues between young adultsimmaturity and fandom Now what that story made me realize is that fan culture has existed for much longer than we give it credit for While westerns may seem dramatic and serious they are highly romanticized and take on the same hero fantasy that is commonly seen in the comic books and fantasy novels created after them and may have singlehandedly spawned the comic book genre Now I feel that anyone looking at his grandfather would never see him as childish for his love of westerns Hes a military veteran a carpenter and a family man with a cowboys dry humor I can only imagine this developed from the large amount of Westerns he has watched since his youth So the question becomes why is there a difference between nostalgic immaturity in entertainment in his era as compared to our own Why is his entertainment not generally seen as childish when it entails all of the same tropes as the current comic book movies and medieval adventure epics that grace our theaters today
2015-05-19 09:51:50,4,0,4,Focus,Im pretty sure he knows about the scope of science fiction  I think hes referring to the more surface level sci fi the type of stuff with simplistic storylines and more of a focus on style over actual substance  This would include stuff like Star Wars Avatar Guardians of the Galaxy etc  I really dont think Pegg would ever criticize hard sci fi
2015-05-19 11:22:58,2,0,2,Focus,I think the image is somewhat distorted by the focus we place on box office revenue As the cost of cinema tickets went up I started limiting my cinema visits to films I thought would really benefit from a big screen The Hobbit and the Avengers come to mind  These films are also less likely to be ruined by an inconsiderate cinema goer being in your vicinity  I watch emotional or intelligent films at home on a smaller screen for a fraction of the cost
2015-05-19 11:46:24,3,0,3,Focus,Yes but those were not box office mega hits like what we see now As much as I enjoy a good popcorn flick I agree that films with more substance should be our main focus There are films out there like that but they are independent and now do as well as those sci fi B films you listed Shoot theres even some great mature sci fi out there you just have to work hard to find it I dont mean mature like mature content just not infantile
2015-05-19 12:20:40,38,0,38,Focus,Seriously who the fuck is friends with people who would actively not go see a movie because of some bullshit feminist shit this entire drama is so fucking benign these people need real problems to focus on god forbid the girls in Mad Max arent complete fucking pussies and god forbid they actually turn out to be great characters Fuck everything about that movement id rather turn them all upsidown and use them as bloodbags before i listen to another whiney note out of their mouths

2015-05-19 13:54:05,1,0,1,Focus,I totally agree It absolutely has thoughtprovoking elements and there is more to the story than action but at the end of the day it is an action movie and the heavy focus is on that I loved everything about it dont get me wrong haha but I dont think its strongest point is its message

2015-05-19 14:29:19,20,0,20,Focus,I agree the conversations can be repetitive but I disagree that villains should be the focus of conversation Women regardless of their role in a story tend to be badly written as characters often serving as sexual rewards for male characters or eye candy or the one woman added to the story Or as you mention a female character so empowered that they arent a real character  yet another example of Hollywood now knowing how to write real female characters Regardless of whether theyre a villain or not But you seem to imply that we should focus exclusively on advocating for more evil women on screen That would be part of having more gender equality but far from all of it Im also not arguing that women are the only people impacted by gender roles in films depictions of masculinity on screen can also be harmful in different ways though an important difference is that men are almost always the ones in power calling the shots behind the scenes and regardless of how theyre depicted men are disproportionately the focus of stories and dominant in the cast of our films Fair enough about the conversation getting repetitive though the Internet can be a huge echo chamber It can be good to show support for films that challenge past stereotypes even if it is repetitive because it helps create momentum and show the industry that people want new types of stories But I can also see how that can get exasperating

2015-05-19 22:34:57,1,0,1,Focus,I guess I hadnt read any discussions on because I was waiting until I could see it It just went to digital rental so I checked it out Its just weird that they focus the movie on this guy but you know nothing about him his fears he passions his motivation I couldnt even figure out if he and his wife even liked each other Its an oddly told story that really just makes him this guy who always makes the right decision despite the chaos around him Maybe that really is who this guy was but I imagine there is more depth to him than what we saw on screen
2015-05-19 22:37:44,3,0,3,Focus,Yeah I agree I wouldve liked it more if they focused more on the technical NASA aspect of it all Not some sappy love theme to tie it all together Oh but love transcends galaxies puke
2015-05-19 23:22:06,1,0,1,Focus,Maybe Im the last of the breed but I just enjoy movies for what they are I thought it was a good action movie and didnt expect Hollywood to make it very accurate to the real story I read the book for that They could have made it more about the PTSD and drama but it wasnt done like that so personally I have it a waste of time to even play with the idea and focus on how it was done People always complain about movies having plot holes ect ect instead of being entertained Im just ranting now because its something I see in movies that dont even portray anything real but I guess its their loss not mine

2015-05-20 06:02:28,18,0,18,Focus,There are great feminists doing great work and there are overzealous and not particularly critical feminists just like in almost any ideological framework  I havent encountered a single thoughtful and welladjusted person claiming to be a Mens Rights Activist or even one devoted to the cause via a mechanism other than loud complaining  I see the two situations as much different  There are Men involved in gender equality that do Work to make things better in ways that are focused on supporting men or redefining masculinity but they also seem to work very hard to distance themselves from MRAs and often identify as feminists
2015-05-20 06:47:40,5,0,5,Focus,How exactly has Connor carried a franchise  she was an action hero in T2 but not the lead the focus was undeniably on Arnie and the TV series was good but its two seasons didnt nearly add that much significance to the character to stand up to the Alien movies To me Ripley stands way above Connor
2015-05-20 07:00:33,1,0,1,Focus,Agreed I watched the first few episodes with it on in the background as I browsed or did work or something which is how I usually watch TV Didnt care for it Tried it again months later actually focusing on the show and it came off a lot better for it Peaky Blinders was another one like that for me too

2015-05-20 11:50:44,43,0,43,Focus,Not a very inspired title but Im sure itll be massive I just hope it centers on Max this time Furiosa is a great character but the movie is called Mad Max for a reason Edit Though I know the story doesnt necessarily focus on Max the whole time I think they need to at least give him more agency over the situations rather than just be along for the ride
2015-05-20 12:00:47,6,0,6,Focus,Yup that was a great bit You see Yara walking towards them while the shot is focused on Jay The next shot is looking out towards the ocean and Yara wearing a different outfit slowly drifts into view on an inner tube Then the next shot is a closer view of Jay and The Follower is nowhere to be seen Suddenly her hair gets yanked up Brilliant
2015-05-20 12:22:20,1,0,1,Focus,There was no commentary though The meat of the movie was three simple but effective stories of redemption and a lot of thrilling action Those elements you mention were certainly there but they werent explored in any amount of depth Im glad for that personally the movie was streamlined and focussed and it was great But some people seem to be really insistent that its something else entirely
2015-05-20 12:31:14,13,0,13,Focus,Saw Fury Road this evening Definitely need much more focus on Max overall and Hardy needs to work on the accent which was a tiny bit inconsistent but a sequel will be great
2015-05-20 12:39:16,1,0,1,Focus,I understand your point but thats just not how it should be I think we do need to seek women and minorities to play and direct movies because representation matters I agree that we should focus on quality but there are amazing women and minorities with so much talent So the answer should be to keep looking for great women and minorities
2015-05-20 12:46:21,126,0,126,Focus,Hardy publicly apologised to George Miller at the premiere this week He said that while shooting he didnt quite understand the film and felt frustrated because George was busy setting up stunts When he saw the film he felt guilty Hopefully next time his performance is more focused
2015-05-20 13:09:04,515,0,515,Focus,Eh in terms of action probably but this is why you dont repeat things and try new things If they make it more story focused with unique action sequences like Fury Road had then it could be just as good
2015-05-20 13:37:59,1,0,1,Focus,They can focus more on the acting and story this time  Fury Road is an amazing action flick but the story was basic and the acting was nothing to write home about
2015-05-20 13:48:51,2,0,2,Focus,Road Warrior didnt really focus on Mad Max either
2015-05-20 14:06:59,2,0,2,Focus,True enough After more thought perhaps I was hasty in saying it needed to focus on Max more However Road Warrior has a lot more Max to it if I recall correctly
2015-05-20 14:42:29,4,0,4,Focus,Feminism is IMHO a subset of egalitarianism one focused particularly on gender issues  I regard myself as both  definitely an egalitarian but Ive got more interest in gender issues than say height or disability issues
2015-05-20 14:47:20,2,0,2,Focus,half the movie was playing at a different framerate  if you watch closely even on the closeups the framerate will change multiple times in one shot  I think part of the audio problems are Miller adjusting the framerate to focus on certain facial ticks and make the movie feel jerky  There isnt a good way to speed up and slow down the audio in step with the video
2015-05-20 14:58:17,5,0,5,Focus,Not in the first one While he was certainly reacting to events around him the focus was certainly on Max It wasnt until the second movie that he became more of a supporter of the real heroes

2015-05-20 15:28:21,2,0,2,Focus,It would be kind of cool if they are able to develop the Mad Max universe itself and expand it richly to the point that tons of great content can be created within it that focuses on different characters places etc
2015-05-20 16:09:24,-1,0,-1,Focus,Its a cool design but its just as heavy handed of a concept to me as the tagline itself His instability definitely should be a focus but I hope this marketing isnt representative of how they handle it in the film with this THE REAL CHESS BATTLE WAS GOING ON IN HIS MIND shit
2015-05-20 16:46:08,5,0,5,Focus,I feel the directors owned the fact that the story was predictable by giving not so subtle hints as to who the bomber was They realized that there was no way to go about the story without being predictable so rather than surprising the audience with the twists they just focused on tying the loop together
2015-05-20 16:51:20,1,0,1,Focus,Sure but I kinda saw them as closer to nuhumans If the Inhumans film focuses on the Royal Family I can see how it would take place off Earth
2015-05-20 17:26:37,113,0,113,Focus,I like that it focusses on a guy that is friendly with every social circle but not quite thriving in any of them Thats what Ive always been like and I havent seen that type of person as a protagonist in film yet so Im excited to see their interpretation of why he is socially the way he is
2015-05-20 17:46:32,3,0,3,Focus,I think stylistically breaking to Maxs recon mission would have broken the constant feel of a car chase that the movie had  I loved the scene it kept the tension on the focus of getting the war rig moving and escaping instead of shifting the main point of tension to is max going to survivekillget back in time it keeps it focused on the chase and escape

2015-05-20 18:39:30,4,0,4,Focus,I was a projectionist and a manager of a theater  Talk to a manager or the projectionist directly the projectionist will come down from the cave if asked nicely  Other employees are commonly very young and we wouldnt hear about things if they were told  Chances are the bulbs are old or the throw glass is dirty or even the lens  All these things are supposed to be cleaned or changed in the case of the bulbs nightly but maybe they are too lax at this location  There is also a chance that the projectionist has bad eyesight I know right and thinks everything is fine  We had a projectionist that had horrible eyesight and worked in the afternoons  When I came in I had to focus all 14 theaters and he was eventually moved to guest services
2015-05-20 18:40:54,3,0,3,Focus,I think thats just the way it was shot Its still rated R I for one am glad the movie choose not to focus on gore and all tht
2015-05-20 18:49:05,6,0,6,Focus,Yeah there have been more of those shots as of late  But I was thinking more about the CGI used to fill out the background or environments  Such as when they add to the height of a building or other details that do not take the major focus of the viewer
2015-05-20 19:33:08,1,0,1,Focus,You got a movie you didnt expect but it was predictable I honestly think you might have just been too focused on what it wasnt

2015-05-20 20:02:19,3,0,3,Focus,After the first movie the other movies are never focused on him  They are about the struggles of the people he is helping  Its mainly their story  Which makes sense because the movies should be taken as if they are legendary stories passed down years in the future via oral history  Max is a Paul Bunyan character of myth that stories are told about in the future when society is somewhat rebuilt
2015-05-20 20:22:27,5,0,5,Focus,Im actually fine with Maxs more lowkey role in the film Having a decent chunk of the focus be on Furiosa especially towards the beginning allowed for both an awesome character to shine and for Maxs actor switch to be less noticeable The audience warms up to the new Max at around the same rate everyone else in the movie warms up to him
2015-05-20 20:30:34,61,0,61,Focus,Im sure the movie will focus on stuff like his personal issuesparanoia the moody tones of the poster suggest its not just a story of a cleancut young American beating the Russkies at their own game
2015-05-20 21:12:04,1,0,1,Focus,Definitely The original Pennywise is a legendary role like you said hes gonna have to focus everything on this role

2015-05-20 21:47:43,2,0,2,Focus,There was a lot about her past that wasnt mentioned For instance you say she is the always good always strong but she states that her goal is redemption If she is always good then she shouldnt feel the need for redemption She obviously has done some bad things in the past but this movie was focusing on her trying to do something good
2015-05-20 22:03:50,1,0,1,Focus,I got the impression from the interview that he didnt watch movies because his main focus was theater plays etc So movies are maybe a side project for him
2015-05-20 22:04:44,3,0,3,Focus,Im going to guess she means focus Especially because it was a postproduction 3D conversion Miller was given choices where he wanted the audiences attention to be at within shots
2015-05-20 22:53:54,1,0,1,Focus,Is Ryan Gosling still rumored to be a lead character I feel he would actually fit Not sure about main character though I doubt Deckard will be the central focus whereas more of a supporting legend
2015-05-20 23:19:24,1,0,1,Focus,Thats my favorite action film free And i loved Mad Max so much i saw it twice in one weekend The cinematography and use of colors is beautiful and the action scenes are shot so that you actually see all of the action Youve gotta see the first one tho that was great as well The story picks up right after the first one ends and the second focuses more on the story so its worth watching
2015-05-20 23:29:16,2,0,2,Focus,Yeah my thought is that producers used to have more freedom to make more interesting unique and art focused decisions which resulted in more great mediumbudget genre films
2015-05-21 00:09:37,7,0,7,Focus,Saw this back in September at TIFF and it absolutely glosses over this fact It focuses mainly on his paranoiaobsession Still a fantastic  film though

2015-05-21 01:43:48,2,0,2,Focus,Well I havent seen the movie yet to tell the truth waiting for the weekend but to be honest I think max has never been the focus of mad max movies besides the first so I think its alright to let it slide I guess
2015-05-21 03:18:41,3,0,3,Focus,Cars had some interesting ideas but no focus 2 was impressively boring and brave felt cookie cutter when compared to the trailer

2015-05-21 08:41:55,2,0,2,Focus,For the record I upvoted you for adding to discussion Having a sexbot wasnt the original plan If you look at the masks in the hall only the last few two were even female  He adds the sexual capability later maybe out of loneliness but also just because he can The way he treats the robots is a strong metaphor for abuse and misogyny and Kyoko and Ava teaming up a massive moment of empowerment but the focus is much more on the sort of Icaruslike pursuit of sentience This interview is pretty revealing httpwwwslashfilmcomexmachinaendingexplained
2015-05-21 10:23:45,9,0,9,Focus,If the feminist movement in the west feels the need to tackle issues like this for a bunch of millionaire actors while women in Africa are still  getting their vaginas mutilated I think its suffice to say feminism has accomplished its goals in the western world And has reached a point of parody like ridiculousness and should focus its effort and attentions to actual issues
2015-05-21 10:23:45,2,0,2,Focus,I think that Finchers films tend to focus a lot on capturing the sensation of being outside really nailing it through the lighting and sound If you look at the scene in fight club where they are walking down the street whacking golf balls into derelict buildings the reverb delay and filtering on the vocals and golfswings really sell the openness of the space and along with the visuals give a good sense of the dankness of the environment Assuming your watching it in a warm place that sense of coziness you feel is in contrast to the environments on screen which are really evocative

2015-05-21 13:05:49,0,0,0,Focus,It is kind of womens fault as it is the fault of everyone as in many movie goers If people see a bad performance by someone but think at least heshes hot there is a problem because the more people overlook bad performance for pure visuals the less reason the industry has to put focus on good roles and good acting Giving women the fault wich you didnt exactly do but could be read like that is not going to help Especially since like someone else here said there are mostly men who have to greenlight scripts Im not saying men are trying to hold down women because the business model is Make movies that make money If people would rather see someone attractive than someone capable of acting then that will make money Thus choices I for one like to see good acting Of course I like to see attractive people but Id rather be immersed into the story than see some eyecandy try to fake emotions
2015-05-21 13:07:22,-4,0,-4,Focus,Youre missing the bigger picture The article in the OP is about women being denied opportunities because they are of a certain age whereas men are not denied opportunities because of the very same reason Instead of discussing this most people in the thread instead focus on her appearance and whether or not shes hot enough Immediately her worth and value is reduced to being eyecandy The point she was trying to raise is instantly dismissed by men who claim they have a better explanation for why she gets no roles and of course this has to do with being attractive That is textbook misogyny denying women their voice ridiculing the points they try to raise reduce their worth to appearance
2015-05-21 13:19:21,2,0,2,Focus,Thats why this article is stupid though  There are different kinds of action movies  Big guys like Arnold or the Rock work well in some action genres not so well in others  If you want to focus on martial arts and guns a smaller guy works better
2015-05-21 13:23:46,1,0,1,Focus,Youre kidding right Of course her looks matter its Hollywood Its an extremely image driven culture One of the most popular Hollywood magazines actually has Vanity in the title Also men age better than women in the attractiveness department Thats a shitty fact of life but its true On top of all that there are plenty of attractive women over 35 still getting roles Michelle Monaghan Vera Farmiga Charlize Theron Cate Blanchett Naomi Watts Leslie Mann Tina Fey Marisa Tomei I think if shes going up for a role where her looks arent the focus of the role then she has a case for being unfairly rejected However if she is up for a role where she is playing the love interest and the attractiveness is central to the role then she shouldnt be surprised if someone 15yrs younger than her gets it Or if someone more attractive than her gets it
2015-05-21 15:38:41,1,0,1,Focus,The issue She looks old for her age This affects casting So what The entire entertainment industry is built on decisions that focus on how old someone looks how attractive they are how good their physique is what their voice sounds like etc Youre building an onscreen character not marrying the fucking actors

2015-05-22 10:56:02,1,0,1,Focus,I 100 agree that there is an issue with Hollywood films depicting romantic relationships with a younger woman and an older man and this has implications for female actors as they get older but that can be dealt with as in independent issue My issue is that there is a huge focus on Maggie Gyllenhaal being too old to be the love interest of a 55 year old like the focus is on the 55 year old male theres nothing disclosed about what age the writers etc want the female role to be if that makes sense I feel like it would be a bigger issue if the role was a 40ish year old woman and Maggie got rejected for being too old but if the part is for a 20ish year old character then she obviously cant play it because she doesnt look that age And that is why I want sources from those who say that the character is meant to be 20ish otherwise this whole argument is something entirely different

2015-05-24 13:29:52,1,0,1,Focus,There are different ways to convert colour to black and white Generally you adjust the lightness of each hue to emulate colour contrast If you just decrease the saturation you may end up with a flat grey throughout a whole image If you darken the blues and lighten the oranges youll get a tonal contrast equivilant to the colour contrast Also black and white isnt always about being retro It is often used to reduce an image to form and counterform Letting you focus on the way shapes interact
2015-05-24 14:08:40,1,0,1,Focus,I think thats a consequence of bad directing I think the director was to focused on pushing the message and not enough on making it a good film Heavy handed political messages are a big risk and a significant flaw in most movies theyre tried But if you have enough other positive aspects in the movie to make up for the heavyhanded political message you get something like District 9 When you dont you get The Day After Tomorrow Monsters was unfortunately a lot closer to The Day After Tomorrow than it was District 9 I think a much better director paired with a far more experienced screenwriter could have pulled it off a lot better
2015-05-24 15:19:32,3,0,3,Focus,I thought I would hate Elementary but I really liked it I like how Holmes is portrayed as what I would consider to be autistic and not in the way that most portrayals do it where hes basically Spock Sherlock is guilty of this Also the focus on addiction makes him a lot more human and gives Watson a chance to become a real asset someone who really needs and not just because he wants a buddy to fight crime with
2015-05-24 15:42:31,1,0,1,Focus,Ill temper everyone elses strong reviews  the book is a good and enjoyable read  That said the writing style can be a bit juvenile and the book reads like the journal of someone autistic  there is very little focus on the emotional or human aspects of being stranded on Mars for such a long time  I think the main characters wife is mentioned only two or three times and one of those is in a jokey Say hit to my wife scene  Thats not necessarily bad but the book would have been a lot stronger if it had had more humanity

2015-05-24 17:29:58,1,0,1,Focus,Perhaps we just focused on different aspects of the same movie based on our individual experiencesexpectations I didnt just make my experience up and neither did you
2015-05-24 17:49:05,7,0,7,Focus,In the same vein even if the best part of the movie is a shocking twist focusing the whole trailer on that aspect makes it easy to predict the shocker before Ive even seen the movie

2015-05-24 19:21:28,3,0,3,Focus,OK I havent seen the movie and I will probably never will but putting the whole blame on Damon Lindelof is unfair in my opinion The script was approved by Disney and I guess the director also found it good enough to devote a LOT of time to make the film The blame should be distributed fairly not solely focused on an individual regardless his notorious track as screenwriter

2015-05-25 02:03:30,7,0,7,Focus,The film itself is simplistic in the same way The Raid or Dredd were  The story is straightforward and establishes itself right away  Because of that the focus dives right into the action and the world building
2015-05-25 02:22:56,1,0,1,Focus,I disagree Personally Id watch absolutely any movie in 3D Even a slow paced drama or romantic comedy And I think any movie can be edited for smooth 3D transitions If you keep the object in focus at screen depth during transitions and make sure to use depth of field appropriately then 3D works great for any cut or transition
2015-05-25 03:28:31,4,0,4,Focus,Or you might think that The Matrix was a better film with a tighter script and more focused acting and you didnt feel it needed the story expanded into two more films no matter what the original intent of the directors
2015-05-25 03:49:33,2,0,2,Focus,I dont mind if its a background thing or not essential to the plot  But if it tries to present something retarded as a scientific statistical fact and base the entire plot around that like in Lucy then its retarded  Imagine a movie about a family struggling with an autistic child because he was vaccinated or a movie focused on how global warming isnt real  That would be irritating
2015-05-25 05:23:02,-1,0,-1,Focus,The problem with modern remakes is they dont just update the special effects which is where it would excel but seem to alter the storylinefocus and so lose what made the movie great or worth seeing in the first place Total Recall is supposedly pretty bad but worst I have seen is The Time Machine The Great Gatsby was surprisingly ok in terms of not ruining the story and it was the casting that left me nonplussed When it comes to remakes its probably not a good thing to have seen the earlier version
2015-05-25 06:09:16,1,0,1,Focus,I get that I think I just have the ability to like it more than other people here because Im pretty young and I hadnt seen the original Robocop until a couple of years ago so I didnt have a huge attachment to it I love both movies a lot but if I had the choice right now to rewatch either of them I would honestly choose the remake It was an excellent commentary on where we are going with automating everything particularly weapons It is extremely relevant to political issues being brought up about technological advancements such as selfdriving cars I felt that much more went into it than being a cash grab because it really did focus on asking thoughtprovoking questions and making statements that you dont normally see in these types of remakesreboots

2015-05-25 07:47:55,3,0,3,Focus,Theres an interesting POV on the same Id read somewhere in one of the many rave reviews floating around I found it particularly interesting It suggested that unlike the old MM films where Max becomes an active ingredient in bringing about a change in certain situations Fury Road focuses more on a different character Imperator Furiosa whos very much like Max in her own way Max is more of a catalyst in bringing about a change in this one  and thats what makes him that guy I found this thought very interesting because Miller going by this thought doesnt seem to have given a fuck about commercerelated questions like what if the viewer hasnt seen the first three or what if people dont like the film being more about Furiosa than Max And whats more interesting is the way how it makes sense  those whove watched 12 and 3 know what Max is all about and will perfectly understand why Max is in less limelight than Furiosa because he doesnt fucking care  but hell help whenever he can And those whore new to the franchise wont give a fuck about Max and will be fuck happy with the action
2015-05-25 08:07:51,1,0,1,Focus,My quick review this film basically was a superior version of previous buddycop films that were failing by simply being stupidly PG13 and relying on excessive juvenile humor and no proper focus This film had an identity and was worth every second at least to me
2015-05-25 08:12:02,0,0,0,Focus,This is actually exactly what happened to that Robin Hood movie Allegedly it was one of the best scripts in Hollywood and it was a detective story focusing on the Sheriff of Nottingham But Russel Crowe and Ridley Scott didnt like it so they changed everything in the script

2015-05-25 13:33:52,1,0,1,Focus,Box Office Mojo is probably correct considering box office is what they focus on
2015-05-25 15:47:06,1,0,1,Focus,People running from falling buildings definitely doesnt need to evoke those feelings But its built into the language of the film We see ground level shaking shots of a building slowly lilting over and falling plumes of smoke filling the streets It looks like cam footage from 911 sharpened up and made more dramatic Its used to focus on characters we barely know to make us care about them It didnt cause outrage for me just seemed cheap
2015-05-25 15:55:14,1,0,1,Focus,Doh Okay My bad I totes misread what you said earlier Im tired and my brain cannot focus on things I agree with ya
2015-05-25 16:02:53,1,0,1,Focus,I think the only way wed see a movie purely focusing on the Autobots if it was fully animated CGI is hard enough to do as it is and trying to make it mesh well with liveaction environments even more so
2015-05-25 16:17:31,1,0,1,Focus,Dude when the world engine is activated thats exactly what we see Also its a PG13 so were not gonna see a shit ton of onscreen deaths but the fact that Metropolis is shown to be heavily populated and then the focus on its utter destruction implies that a lot of people die And again the difference between Man of Steel and Age of Ultron is still that Age of Ultron shows the Avengers rescuing civilians while Man of Steel doesnt I think both are justified tho because the Avengers are a team so its easier for them to multitask meanwhile not only was the threat Superman faced all stronger than than Ultron and his drones he had to do it by himself
2015-05-25 17:21:53,1,0,1,Focus,Regardless though thats just not the point of the movie lol And when you keep putting the focus on that the movie becomes more about physically impossible feats than it does about her characters struggles in the eyes of the publicthen it just gets blasted to hell by people going in LOOKING for physical flaws which is exactly what happened
2015-05-25 18:20:29,3,0,3,Focus,This has always been my critique of referring to RT scores Theoretically an average movie can have a 100 Its highly unlikely but every critic could technically see the movie as a movie that was just good enough to warrant giving a yes which would cause people to think an ok movie will be amazing Yes they have the average score as well but most people tend to focus more on the percentage of critics that liked it
2015-05-25 19:07:37,1,0,1,Focus,I find it really interesting that in the newer posters the focus usually seems to be on the monster or main antagonizer compared to a lot of the older posters where the focus is on the protagonists or victims Its probably because when youre filming a remake of an iconic horror movie the most memorable characters from the originals are typically the monsters murders etc
2015-05-25 20:10:55,-2,0,-2,Focus,28 weeks has so many things wrong with it The main ones being the fact they decided that children should be the focus and unnecessary pandering to the american audience

2015-05-25 23:53:35,1,0,1,Focus,I thought the original idea was more about the military industrial complex and how he goes from weapon back to human Its focused on consumerism and capitalism not really trying to explore the existential aspects Watch ghost in the shell if you want that
2015-05-26 00:01:58,3,0,3,Focus,Have you watched all of the movies The first three films do exactly this The first film was actually criticised for just being a long episode of the show Meanwhile Wrath Of Khan fittingly upped the scale and stakes whilst retaining the core focus on character and the future of science and technology
2015-05-26 00:31:22,1,0,1,Focus,I think that story line did receive quite a bit of focus actually
2015-05-26 00:34:47,1,0,1,Focus,No worries At the same time I have to disagree again Specifically Wrath Of Khan doesnt succeed because of the spectacle Theres hardly any spectacle to behold really Yes First Contact has spectacle and the Abrams films are almost all spectacle but Wrath Of Khan is pure Trek From the character work to the themes of growing old and the pursuit of an obsession that film succeeds for its excellent characterfocused storytelling
2015-05-26 01:52:42,3,0,3,Focus,Yeah thats one of the most iconic sets of all time but not really that impressive in terms of scale or craftsmanship which I think was what this list was focusing on
2015-05-26 04:19:24,2,0,2,Focus,How HOW Every single time the stupid Die Antwoord morons were on screen I just wanted to punch them in the face and get back to the interesting story of an artificial intelligence But no We have to focus on these loud irritating idiots instead And listen to their awful music too The story was so poorly written as well They were building up his whole thing of almost completing the intelligence but there were no stakes He had been working for 3 years whats the freaking rush It couldnt decide if it wanted to be sentimental or an action film so it tried being both and failed at each Also Hugh Jackman Hes a religious but Did we mention hes religious Better make sure he mentions church right after he pulls a gun on the guy and supports the military AMIRITE There were no depth to any of the characters it was completely bland and totally uninteresting and a giant waste of time
2015-05-26 04:25:06,2,0,2,Focus,I feel a little bit the same its just that those things caught my attention because they get short but focused moments during the film
2015-05-26 04:31:57,-4,0,-4,Focus,I doubt Ill cringe at it as much as the other superhero movie I saw which involved a campy robot with a perfectly chiselled ass making a joke every 5 seconds to some fake russians while nobody cared about all the deaths Tony Stark caused because they were too focussed setting up the 50 sequels
2015-05-26 05:45:26,3,0,3,Focus,Yes certainly I think Dredd probably could have done without the intro like that I dont know that it was entirely necessary Pacific Rim on the other hand I think is definitely necessary to establish the world With Dredd and Mad Max the worlds are important aspects but theyre not the main focus The story lines are about these independent action events that are happening inside of these crazy worlds but theyre not totally dependent on them A car chase and a police shootout it could happen anywhere In Pacific Rim the whole problem in the plot IS this crazy world that the movie is set in Giant robots fighting alien monstersnot so dynamic to fit into any world which is why the intro is more necessary Thats my take Im not sure all of that made sense but yeah haha
2015-05-26 05:53:08,1,0,1,Focus,I think OPs focusing more on the summer as of now but even the Fall looks promising with Bridge of Spies The Revenant Hateful Eight and probably a whole slew of other movies that are currently under the radar but will come to light as August and September roll in
2015-05-26 05:54:06,1,0,1,Focus,Id probably go Network and Nightcrawler  Or another movie focussing on a sleazy capitalist to pair with Nightcrawler
2015-05-26 07:00:49,4,0,4,Focus,I think the best way to describe it is focus  Most of the extremely highgrossing action movies are part of a series with a lot of mythology  continuity to satisfy and thus need to be epic in scope in order to satisfy the everexpanding expectations of its fans eg Avengers  MCU Lord of the Rings  Hobbit Star Wars etc
2015-05-26 08:13:49,-36,0,-36,Focus,No I get it Memorial Day shouldnt be a Murica hoedown or whatever and people should have fun in honor of those who no longer can But for fucking sake at least mention these fallen and not focus on the lost profits completely
2015-05-26 08:14:18,3,0,3,Focus,It is an education tool in Australia Victoria Except our main focus in school was the playbook not the movie but everyone still watched the film Learning about in school was so interesting because it tackled so many different issues in society and as you said it is still relevant
2015-05-26 09:02:37,2,0,2,Focus,It wouldnt say doomed unless youre focused on just theater money  The film has sold so much on DVD and bluray that there is a legitimate possibility of a sequel The film has gotten to be number 1 on Amazon a bunch of times since its release
2015-05-26 09:41:32,2,0,2,Focus,Ive watched a lot of WOAH BRO SUCH A TRIPPY MOVIE IM SO HIGH LOL movies and still find perfectly normal movies like Heathers and Her and whatnot far more interesting and hilarious The true joy comes when you get high and honestly try to focus on watching a good movie in my opinion Just pick something you think youll enjoy and youll probably enjoy it
2015-05-26 11:12:11,1,0,1,Focus,Yeah it is for several reasons though Most people are straight and it just doesnt occur to them And we very rarely see gay characters But also heterosexual friends can have a really close almost romantic relationship Personally i dont see the point of focusing a story line on someones sexuality like its not gonna have a bearing on the plot unless its a romance film
2015-05-26 11:23:55,-8,0,-8,Focus,So you would rather discuss Marvel movies all the time instead of focusing on lesser known productions
2015-05-26 11:44:19,1,0,1,Focus,In my example its not a focus possibly why so many people claim its not there despite all the suggestions and obvious moments but it is a part of each of them growing up and discovering who they want to be how they feel about each other etc Its a character arc thing
2015-05-26 11:51:05,1,0,1,Focus,I love this film because its main character is not the main focus of the film he is as you mentioned essentially a lens for the audience to piece together the wider context in which the story is taking place
2015-05-26 13:16:57,4,0,4,Focus,I know Im in the minority with this opinion but I really hated this movie  I thought it had really great design elements excellent stunts and action and filming the skeleton of the movie was great  The truly terrible part of the movie for me was that there was utterly no character development or development of any kind  The mad max universe wasnt hashed out  Every character was static  I often thought that I wouldnt have cared at all if any of the characters had died  I was bored  I wasnt hoping that they get away safely I was hoping that the movie would end  Everything was great except for the screenwriting  I know that going plotless is going to be a big trend in the future and I will stop paying to see movies that arent plot focused
2015-05-26 13:36:37,1,0,1,Focus,Great list but Id recommend maybe some more focus on foreign films It might be more difficult but Id say keep it in mind
2015-05-26 13:38:12,-1,0,-1,Focus,It has awesomeness and most movies anymore dont have that but it also had an awful lot of garbage  Random mono colored scenes there were completely out of place thrown in like it was 300 or Sin City lack of framing shots so you only see one car at a time in order to make impossible parts work and a villain that had no connection to Max making him a completely redundant secondary character to Furiosa and Nux  There were also some seriously amateur problems with sound and special effects at certain points  So yeah depending on what you focus on this could be pure crap or pure win
2015-05-26 13:56:05,4,0,4,Focus,Honestly Ive never been so legitimately angry about an ending since ME3 If they included the rest of the cast weve grown to love Id excuse it However by leaving them out and focusing solely on Korrassami they succumb to fanservice Just watch the fan reactions to the ending they squeal like I did at the Star Wars Ep VII trailers
2015-05-26 13:57:02,1,0,1,Focus,Gravity Snowpiercer Dredd and even the original Speed can be included here I was so focused on John Wick and Fury Road I left out a lot of films
2015-05-26 13:59:25,55,0,55,Focus,I think of Max as a sort of catalyst in the movies this force of nature the other protagonists interact with and are changed thereby Its never his story thats the focus its the way he moves into and out of the stories of others And its done brilliantly Its genius on George Millers part that allows him to flesh out a cast of amazing characters and an incredible world with different actual protagonists in each movie tied together by this dangerous  but ultimately good  mad man who stumbles through their lives We already know Maxs story We dont actually need more of it we just need to see how it changes other people
2015-05-26 14:29:16,1,0,1,Focus,Yes Fantastic writing It didnt insult the viewers intelligence They left so much up for our imagination to fill in the blanks and that added so so much to the story I contrast it to Godzilla which was ruined by the writing They tried to fill in every little detail of the story and make some long arc about one family Really they just needed huge monsters destroying and some loose story and mystery just like Mad Max had We didnt need an hour trying to scientifically explain giant monsters that breath lightning Mad Max and Interstellar prove that movie magic is still alive but it is driven by writing and creativity not focus grouped lowest common denominator profit driven films
2015-05-26 14:52:49,4,0,4,Focus,I havent seen it but judging from the trailers it is a militaryfocused film Isnt it more appropriate that the cast be majority white given that many white Americans in the military are stationed in Hawaii
2015-05-26 14:55:34,1,0,1,Focus,Sadly there can be distractions even when youre focused I saw it at the Alamo Drafthouse and people kept talking during the entire freakin movie Alamos notorious for its  zero tolerance notalking policy during films but we couldnt figure out who was doing it and Alamo staff dont seem to stop it unless its directly reported So we had a few instances of Who the fuck keeps talking and missing a halfintelligible grunt
2015-05-26 15:02:02,2,0,2,Focus,Oh I know I know Still with a lot of movies remakes focus on revamping the effects or telling the idea in a different way When its something like 12 Angry Men where its all in one room it creates a lot less ways to really change the movie I realize if they see a market for a remake theyd do it but I still fail to see a way to meaningfully remake the movie At least when they do 80s movie remakes I kind of see the logic because a lot are effects heavy and we have much better capabilities now
2015-05-26 15:42:58,1,0,1,Focus,I think its more a sign of the end of unnecessary CG and silly action sequences  Both movies shed the green screens and focused on action that was not cartoony and impossible im looking at you molten gold surfing Hobbit

2015-05-26 16:50:42,1,0,1,Focus,Its basically just a full movie version of that Futurama  episode  But really  I feel like its just demeaning to video games and gamers  It just seems like the main characters arent the cool guys who play video games  but just loser nerds who do nothing but play video games And instead of making a focus on video game aspect sin the movies  theyre literally just taking old popular video games and throwing them at the screen to draw audiences  Look at films like Tron and Scott Pilgrim vs The World  They use video games as a foundation  building up from those homages and tropes  They have depth and charm to not only gamers but the general audience as well
2015-05-26 17:12:07,478,0,478,Focus,Akira is an amazing film for reasons beyond its attention to detail though I greatly appreciate that I think this video undercuts why Akira is great and just focuses on the technical adeptness
2015-05-26 17:16:41,3,0,3,Focus,Its what Ive been saying for years The main character had no right to be the focus of Godzilla If he werent there everything would have gone exactly the same if not better since apparently nobody else knows how to arm a goddamn nuclear warhead that they end up setting to drift out to sea because detonating a nuclear weapon in the middle of a populated city regardless of whether or not its inside a monsters stomach is a horrible horrible idea
2015-05-26 17:25:29,1,0,1,Focus,I understood 98 of it but sometimes I had to really focus on the characters
2015-05-26 18:47:19,17,0,17,Focus,You mean FF3  I actually thought it was a good film  The characters in it were great the focus was actually on the carsscene and not a heist  Plus it gave us Han though technically that wasnt his first time in a film who was easily one of my favorite characters in the franchise
2015-05-26 18:48:40,4,0,4,Focus,Looks very focused to me No use wasting energy being frantic

2015-05-26 19:22:49,2,0,2,Focus,I understand what hes talking about but its not a new technique or breakthrough in screenwriting Its just a tight focused script
2015-05-26 19:23:00,1,0,1,Focus,I still love this movie as a sick at home and dozing on the couch movie Its light and fun and you dont have to focus too much on plot or anything Its the fast food of cinema No one is saying its good good but its good for what it is
2015-05-26 19:27:10,6,0,6,Focus,Im not sure if I can agree with that Id say watch the Dubs first so you can really focus on how amazing the movie looks then you should watch the subs Thats personal preference but I feel like with the level of detail put into the animation Id rather be able to drink that in first and focus on it then I can enjoy the dubs But again personal preference
2015-05-26 19:53:01,4,0,4,Focus,Right there was the Hulk vs Ironman fight too as a fight between heroes I think what I was focusing on the films climax which seem to fall flat because it breaks into this many on many melee
2015-05-26 20:54:21,1,0,1,Focus,Is no one else confused as to why the poster focussed on this scene when its only one part of an otherwise surfingbased film This makes it look like a skydiving movie
2015-05-26 21:00:30,1,0,1,Focus,The marketing for the physical release was completely focussed on the name Live Die Repeat Its prominently featured on the boxart with Edge of Tomorrow relegated to an afterthought on the cover and most digital stores have it listed as Live Die Repeat Edge of Tomorrow They all but completely changed the name For all intents and purposes the film is now called Live Die Repeat
2015-05-26 21:08:41,2,0,2,Focus,Because he was wrong He was using Korra as an example of audiences being used to Hetero relationships and that is why they didnt see the relationship coming Or that audiences need over romance plot in order for people to see a relationship go from platonic to romantic The problem with Korra was that Korra and Asami had little development in general Their relationship in general had poor development and little focus in the story that is why people found the romance came out of nowhere
2015-05-26 21:12:24,0,0,0,Focus,Im just focused on the saturation and greed They are the greediest of all studios and that says alot Their marketing and ads arent too much until they blitz about 12 months before each release The abundance of films isnt much now but each Phase has had 6 films each and Phase 3 will have 10 They seem to not care about story unless its small like Thor or Winter Soldierjust connecting the past to present foreshadowing the future and showcasing the superhero strengths Im not a big action person so Im already tired of it Disney hardly ever tries with anything They only try with animation but you ever realize everything else is just mediocre or good But yeah I am not saying Marvel films are bad but that Disney will overexpose Star Wars just Marvel and its unecessary
2015-05-26 22:04:02,5,0,5,Focus,I saw it on the largest IMAX screen in the world and some of the shots were out of focus Everything in space was crystal clear Did you notice this or was it just my theater
2015-05-26 22:09:27,3,0,3,Focus,The reason why they gave such an expansion of Hawkeye was to build up the thought that he was going to die in this film This is a common trope found in Joss Whedons work and when all of his traits came into play it was pretty clear that Barton would get the axe EXCEPT when the situation presents itself to clearly kill of the character Quicksilver comes in and sacrifices his life for Clints Whedon subverted his own trope bringing it into further focus with the reoccurring linebanter between Quicksilver and Hawkeye You didnt see that coming Not only is it directed at Barton but at the audience as well
2015-05-26 23:06:01,-1,0,-1,Focus,Not enough focus on Max
2015-05-26 23:26:27,1,0,1,Focus,Of course great actors are able to act well no matter the circumstance but the argument here is that it is just simply easier for an actor to act well when they dont have to imagine the entire set around them in addition to focusing on their character their lines their emotions etc Say for instance that an actor is in a scene where they have to bludgeon somebody with a candlestick Sure they could just pretend to be holding a candlestick and still do the scene just fine but if they are actually holding something in their hand it feels more real The actor can feel the weight of the object which allows them to make more realistic motions They can focus on the act of bludgeoning and not have to imagine what the candlestick is supposed to feel like and how they should move so it looks like theyre actually holding a candlestick Actors dont necessarily need an actual set and props but it sure makes their jobs a hell of a lot easier regardless of talent level
2015-05-26 23:30:21,9,0,9,Focus,I think you misspelled awesome It put more of a focus on characters and less of a focus on dudes just getting better power levels Basically what Toriyama excels at having characters that are interesting and fun to watch without everything being super serious
2015-05-26 23:44:06,8,0,8,Focus,I would argue that Point Break was more about the characters and Fast and Furious was about the action But they are definitely inherently similar This movie just seems more focused on big action than the original
2015-05-26 23:50:45,0,0,0,Focus,I loved it for it No distractions no high complexities that go nowhere Just some people a truck and a need to survive Its refreshing and allows you to focus on the characters
2015-05-27 01:13:38,21,0,21,Focus,I enjoyed it and was on the edge of my seat the entire time Because we watched a trailer for it right before we went to see it I kept thinking Caleb is an AI and the Turing test is for him I was pleasently surprised this was not the case Ironically my favorite parts of the movie were Caleb and Nathan interacting with each other discussing the morals and ethics of what they were doing Because they were discussing all of that it really made the ending sing The girl playing Ava did great with what she was given but she didnt really push it past any other AI focused movie Her design very cool
2015-05-27 02:09:31,5,0,5,Focus,When it comes to dubbing I typically find the dubs way more distracting than reading subtitles Im not sure I could focus on how awesome a movie looks while a narrative about how much I hate the dubbing is streaming through my head
2015-05-27 02:21:36,2,0,2,Focus,Warner Bros is more focus on the medium budget filmssure they have small and big budgets but they pay alot more attention to originality diverse film matter and budgets in the 3080 million range something like that haha They produce more films a year and yes most arent all too shabby The fact is they give the art form the space and tools to still make us believe at times The only thing I can rave about DC is Warner lets the filmmaker run it Marvel wants complete control and exploits new and upcoming filmmakers Nolan is one the greats of our generation and most inventive right Who is the studio he always goes to Warner Bros For every Hobbit they had 5 bad ones Same for Harry Potter Theyve seen the greatness in such scripts as Gravity Pacific Rim Gatsby LEGO Movie Her Edge of Tomorrow Mad Max Fury Road etc They just really shock me at time is all Disney is known for great animation and mediocre live action Paramount is all about mediocre big budgets that I can think of Columbia is big and small but their subs Sony Pictures and Sony Pictures Classics are great Universal takes some risks too such as continuing Fast amp Furious and Ted But WB Wow lol
2015-05-27 02:22:07,4,0,4,Focus,Depth of Field on the 70mm IMAX film is extremely narrow Nailing perfect focus 100 of the time is extremely difficult Were talking a millimeter or two of depth of field in some cases

2015-05-27 04:11:00,2,0,2,Focus,I felt like GITS was going to lead to something a bit more impressive than what we got The sequels are somewhat boring and unfocused
2015-05-27 04:52:38,2,0,2,Focus,Thats a not a fair comparison though Comparing a city made from wooden planks to one made in a computer is not the same as a musical performance In the case of music the musician generally doesnt interact with the medium that changes formateg Analog recordingplayback to digital With film and movies though the actor must interact with whats around him and this performance can be considerably more difficult in a simplified environment such as a green room The audience can subconsciously perceive this change too You are adding to many underground variables to the acting when this is done Ask any actorI have done so myself and theyll tell you that when they are on a real setbuilt or otherwiseits easier to focus on actually acting and putting yourself in that situation I hope Im making sense here If not please correct me because this is how I see it
2015-05-27 06:13:12,1,0,1,Focus,True but theres a clear difference between saying Assuming wormholes exist this is what it would look like going through one given our current understanding of physics And lets just assume you can survive the journey because itll be fun and lead to an interesting story and saying Going into a black hole causes travel back in time via a tesseract created by fifth dimensional beings that also focuses on the main characters daughters bedroom so that she can discover her dads message and save the world because we want a happy ending and you cant technically prove us wrong
2015-05-27 08:50:42,2,0,2,Focus,I dont think Edgar Wright would be the right fit for this at all The tone would be all wrong He made some great movies in the Cornetto trilogy but his only substantial adaptation work was Scott Pilgrim which I personally didnt care for Regardless of what you think of Scott Pilgrim its undeniably very different from the feel that a League of Extraordinary Gentlemen film would need At least Snyder can put together a gritty and captivating atmosphere and Matthew Vaughn in pretty good at that as well Wright is a great director but this isnt his game  I would rather see him focus on more action comedies
2015-05-27 10:14:46,1,0,1,Focus,Actually what people dislike about the movie is the awkward stilted dialogue hamfisted exposition overloads bland characters who feel robotic when they shouldnt pacing issues and some other things And yet you guys never seem to jump to defend any of that Its the scientifically accurate argument you like to focus on which most of the movies detractors arent really concerned with so youre really just tooting your own horn
2015-05-27 10:41:20,2,0,2,Focus,Just did a bad job at making a connection with the audience and the characters Han Solo Princess Leia and luke had a lot of personality and the characters in the prequels did not Another problem is its a prequel with Anakin being the main focus of the story so we already know whats going to happen in the end Lastly The writing wasnt good its Star Wars we have this entire universe and all this potential to make an original story and they gave us repetitive themes and situations For example Luke untrained destroys the Death Star anakin does the same to the space station or whatever Only one way to destroy both spaceships Stuff like that on top of it the dialogue
2015-05-27 12:33:40,3,0,3,Focus,It would be a shitty movie if the crammed to much into it though Im happy that they are focusing on making a movie that appeals to everyone and not just fans of the series Jamming 3 games into 1 movie would make it a terrible movie
2015-05-27 12:37:19,2,0,2,Focus,They messed up the first one by focusing to much the the extraordinary bits and not enough on the gentlemen angle I want this movie to be two hours of people drinking bandy smoking cigars and saying Yes yes Of course of course While they discuss the emerging Asian markets and the latest news from the colonies
2015-05-27 13:40:52,30,0,30,Focus,I loved the first hour of Silent Hill  It just kind of loses its focus when the cult shows up  Still a pretty good film overall
2015-05-27 13:45:54,2,0,2,Focus,The Stunt Man 1980 Director Richard Rush supposedly invented rack focus for it As in shifting focus from sharp foregroundblurry background to blurry foregroundsharp background Like shifting back and forth from action in the foreground to the background not by camera moves or editing but by shifting focus
2015-05-27 14:28:52,6,0,6,Focus,This is a dream of mine and obviously not just VHS Id do DVD as well but Id want to focus on hard to find stuff I just fear it wouldnt be financially sustainable and I cant afford to take a risk like that

2015-05-27 14:57:13,2,0,2,Focus,Hang about in Venice Beach and you get handed them all the time  its focus group testing mostly seeing if it works the ending is good that sort of thing
2015-05-27 15:28:19,2,0,2,Focus,RLM went into this a bit  They basically said Max is more of a vessel into this world where we witness a story happening that isnt focused on him exclusively  He just happens to be there and is a part of something larger going on  Whats also great about it is hes not some invincible action hero that can get out of any situation by himself  Theres a little luck and a some fortuitous planning on his part but in the end he still feels pain and endures misery just like the rest

2015-05-27 20:20:34,3,0,3,Focus,I came here to say this but also to add they could make a pretty decent sequel to BttF if they focused on bringing in new charactersactors to just continue the story in the same universe Its a great story and family friendly and fun so modern kidsyoung people could appreciate it without completely ruining it for the rest of us A few cameos from MJF and have Christopher Lloyd reprise his role They could spend the whole movie chasing someone through time hopping back and forth to different periods to see what changes have been made as they try to determine which change sets things back on the right path
2015-05-27 20:51:35,1,0,1,Focus,Directors vision is for cinephiles Well fuck why not  save money and shoot the film without a fucking director Hell who needs a cinematographer just make sure the stars face is visible Can you focus a lens Good you have a month and a half until we start post
2015-05-27 21:35:59,1,0,1,Focus,Having real physical sets as opposed to some green screen and having your actor speak into nothingness can really help an actor focus and get in the right frame of mind to make a scene even more powerful   Imagine if Matt had been speaking to nothing in that climactic scene  It would have been very difficult to get to that emotional place had the actress not been on the other side
2015-05-27 22:10:45,1,0,1,Focus,As someone who doesnt care about any of that stuff and just wants to see good movies I wish they would focus more on developing good stories and characters and less on making sure their films interlock in superficial ways
2015-05-27 22:49:35,2,0,2,Focus,Wreck it Ralph is kind of cheating because while it features existing game franchises it isnt focused on any of them
2015-05-27 23:46:27,1,0,1,Focus,And movies in 360 degrees sound cool and all until you realize your view may be focused on the wrong thing when the action hits and you could miss it  Just like the article mentions you might be looking at the people running from the monster instead of the monster itself  Sure you could back it up and replay it to see what you missed but that would totally kill the immersion
2015-05-28 02:40:36,1,0,1,Focus,You know I think 2015 is a good year for movies but the only movie I saw this year that I didnt like was poltergeist But all and all it might just be taste not every movie is for everyone just know what you are walking into Like if u want to see a comedy that is what you expect or a action film its what you expect I liked interstellar because it is a scifi I expected a ton of talking and a ton of science shit not really looking forward to action but it was a bonus at parts I liked tusk because it was a comedydrama I didnt expect much but it delivered my expectations Poltergeist is a horror I basicly got what what was delivered in the 80s didnt deliver my expectations and basicly had nothing to offer for me although the film quality was spectacular I kinda went off on a tangent but modern movies are focusing more on ground breaking technology and experimenting with technology If you want a old school style movie with none of the fake cgi bullshit watch the new mad max So in conclusion I dont blame you Most modern movies suck flaky pubes
2015-05-28 02:43:51,3,0,3,Focus,I think it really depends on what kind of movie youre watching what kind of person you are and what kind of people are in the theater Im one of those people that can hear someone chomp on popcorn with their mouth open from 9 rows away and that is all I can focus on Any little sound annoys the ever living crap out of me  With that being said when I saw 21 Jump Street the theater was sold out and the audience enhanced the experience because of the collective laughter
2015-05-28 04:45:14,44,0,44,Focus,Yeah Christopher Lee was the alpha dog on campus with the hottest girl in the school on his arm Mary Magdalene  Jesus had a crush on her from the first moment he saw her but he never worked up the courage to say something until Christopher Lee and Mary Magdalene broke up at a big party just before Christopher Lee was about to go off to college on a football scholarship They made a movie about the story actually  Its called Cant Hardly Wait  Another working title was The King of the Jews is Crazy about Yous but focus groups felt that was too on the nose

2015-05-28 06:13:23,0,0,0,Focus,Because both comedies and horror abandon conventional storytelling Horror movies do not need happy endings or a clear protagonist and deaths dont matter Comedies do not have to focus on the story or character development and instead focus more on the humor of different situations In other words they do not need to be logical or structured in any way I mean most horror movies in the eighties just involved a masked killer running around killing people I love slasher flicks so dont misquote me Or how about Airplane one of the most famous comedies of all time and it was just comedic retelling of another movie you cant do that in any other genre Ultimately both genres just dont take themselves seriously so critics find it hard to do the opposite
2015-05-28 06:45:42,18,0,18,Focus,The point was they didnt have to look alike The world was so focused on genetics they barely registered faces and the like on ID cards
2015-05-28 07:13:21,1,0,1,Focus,It looks extremely watchable but the ridiculousness of the intensity portrayed in the trailer needs to be acknowledged The political consequences are going to be pumped up and exaggerated 10100x the actual worth Bobby Fischer is fascinating due to his greatness and his psychosis Hopefully Im wrong and thats what the film is going to be exaggerating for effect and focusing on instead of the cold war angle For me the degree to which they play up the cold war angle will be the deciding factor in whether the movie is fun or good
2015-05-28 07:22:53,3,0,3,Focus,I wholly agree with you and Im sure the kid was ecstatic with it but my point was this if you make a cake then advertise for it and sell tickets to the cake I think its ok for everyone to question the quality of the cake if its not up to snuff Its not a perfect metaphor but Im sure you get where Im going with it Just as theres nothing morally wrong with letting your kid make a movie theres nothing wrong morally or otherwise with critiquing it to the same standards you would any other film Having said that that guy with the glasses Nostalgia Critic does have a habit of being needlessly verbose much like this comment yes Im blinded by the irony and angry Thats his character so Id take a lot of his reviews with a grain of salt Also I kind of wish he went more in depth with the review part of the review instead of just focusing on his retelling of the movie Also is that lesbian his girl friend now I havent kept up with his show at all
2015-05-28 11:34:25,2,0,2,Focus,Its a character film Not saying that should make it any better for you but a character film focuses on the character rather than the story

2015-05-28 12:38:43,1,0,1,Focus,gt Saying they make the world smaller is I guess a bit confusing  what they do is they compress the world They dont improve your eyesight obviously they compress the world into the limited region of focus you have
2015-05-28 14:01:51,4,0,4,Focus,I wouldnt want it to be part of a franchise but a femalecentered movie in the mafia genre would be awesome  Something that focuses on wives and children of the Godfathers and Goodfellas  knowing what their family does without having evidence having their own power wars and politics dealing with privilege while having to keep secrets etc

2015-05-28 14:46:21,6,0,6,Focus,Yeah I hear ya The romance as it were was never the focus of the film Though their shared experience was I guess I thought the song fit because the last time through she thanked him even kissed him and said he was a good man All that is erased and now he has to figure out how to let her know what happened I always guessed what he would say Something like Youre middle name is Rose I was you at Verdun and we did this together

2015-05-28 16:29:07,3,0,3,Focus,I liked that movie because it focused more on the characters relationships and how they deal with the stress rather than action

2015-05-28 19:41:18,0,0,0,Focus,So at the same time you are arguing with me and agreeing with the premise of my first comment Which is that the movie is good but its not a movie that focuses on plot or story very much which youve exemplified in your responses and so from a screenwriter perspective its not all that amazing
2015-05-28 22:29:29,2,0,2,Focus,But then I can be amazed by the original without comparing it If I watched the re make after then I would just be watching it in comparison the the original and be focusing on how little justice it does I imagine from the other replies
2015-05-28 22:32:21,2,0,2,Focus,The Jurassic Park analogy is actually really a good comparison because the exact reasons why the second and third movies are so comparatively bad are the same reasons why I think a lot of people didnt like Godzilla The second and third movies revolve around a forgettable plot and stiff cardboard cutout characters whereas the first movie had really fantastic action was focused on the monsters but also had really quite exceptional acting In my opinion you need a mixture of both good acting and a monster focus for a monster movie to be considered good
2015-05-28 22:49:19,34,0,34,Focus,It wasnt anything exceptional but I thought it was still pretty good Having read the book I wished it focused more on Chris Kyles PTSD Bradley Coopers performance was great as always but I didnt understand its Oscar buzz last year
2015-05-28 23:13:52,3,0,3,Focus,Wow I hope they focus on making this funny instead of an actual drama cause that is definitely whats going to happen

2015-05-28 23:58:04,1,0,1,Focus,Beyblades just horrible to adapt to live action in general All the anime characters would look stupid in real life and the camera angles need to focus mostly on the beyblades anyway
2015-05-29 00:26:44,4,0,4,Focus,I feel like people dont understand Killians motivations Sure Tony ditching him was the start of his scheme but revenge was never the end goal Tony only made himself the focus when he gave out his address to a terrorist Killians whole scheme was to control the war on terror and profit That had nothing to do with Stark
2015-05-29 01:13:21,1,0,1,Focus,Thats my thought as well It would make way more sense to have things kick off with Batman but shift focus to the Joker and the rest of the team for the duration of the film

2015-05-30 05:48:18,1,0,1,Focus,Fair enough  I honestly couldnt disagree more  Personally Id rather a title fit the story  Fitting the story can be explicit like Snakes on a Plane where you know exactly what youre going to getand thats fine  I agree that Die Hard is a good explicit title because it sums up main character Mcclains tenacity very well  To me the best titles make you ask the question why is the movie called that  If a movie is focused on a central character part of the enjoyment for me at least is discovering through the film why that persons story is worth telling  That goes for Michael Clayton Forrest Gump The Big Lebowski Rocky Balboa Captain Phillips or Jerry Maguire  The way I figure if I am truly intrigued by a movie the trailers IMDB and other forms of media at my disposal do a pretty good job of informing me what I can expect  You mention films named for well known figures like Lincoln that give a clear picture of what to expect  Imagine what a nonAmerican who has never even heard of Lincoln might approach the film  Also consider films such as Mask Seven Whiplash The Matrix or The Shining  When you first hear those titles you may have images or concepts that initially come to mind However within the context of the film they are attached to those meanings often change dramatically  To me this makes films and film titles all the more interesting  Imagine if every movie was named Not Another Teen Movie or Scary Movie 5 or Epic Movie  Things would get pretty boring however Hollywood marketing experts may disagree with me

2015-05-31 05:55:25,1,0,1,Focus,Youre right they havent The focus for superhero movies isnt on the actors but the characters and their presence in the public consciousness The roles have given Evans Ruffalo etc significant leverage within the industry but havent redefined their general standing within the culture
2015-05-31 06:03:42,4,0,4,Focus,Hes still a great Director But his writing needs work For some reason no one is questioning his writing or somehow theyre just trusting him too much As a Director hes still really focused on his vision from a visual perspective and usually casts good people for the roles but he writes his movies as well and he isnt a good writer Not yet
2015-05-31 07:34:23,1,0,1,Focus,The entire time youre focused on smelling what The Rock is cookin
2015-05-31 11:16:55,1,0,1,Focus,gt Id say you are focusing on the focusing so to speak rather than the visual system here
2015-05-31 13:18:09,2,0,2,Focus,Movie that focuses on the gangs rather than one big super villain The super villains such as frieze and Ivy are basically hired mercenaries for people like falcons two face maroni etc
2015-05-31 16:52:02,18,0,18,Focus,So many people dont seem to focus on making a good soundtrack these days Its all the InceptionDark Knight heavy strings and large bombastic hits Even Fury Road had that to a degree Elysium too
2015-05-31 17:26:14,327,0,327,Focus,Yeah I cant imagine they would just leave them out The trailer probably just doesnt focus on them because they are not as famous A trailer is marketing material youre gonna market the members who are most well known
2015-05-31 17:45:14,7,0,7,Focus,The movie might have focus on them though this is just the trailer which is completely different
2015-05-31 18:30:23,5,0,5,Focus,its focused on the group NWA if he were there hed be a side character at most Its not really important to the groups history
2015-05-31 18:35:42,4,0,4,Focus,Yeah but theyre not making this movie exclusively for hardcore fans of NWA Theyre making this movie the reason 90 of movies are made to make money Fans of the group are going to see the movie regardless they have to make it appealing to a broader audience then Are you really that surprised and offended that the trailers are focusing on the more recognizable members of the group
2015-05-31 18:36:48,2,0,2,Focus,While not quite as good as City of God GomorrahhttpenwikipediaorgwikiGomorrah_28film29 is pretty great  It focuses on the interactions of different levels of the Casalesi crime syndicate in Naples
2015-05-31 18:40:02,1,0,1,Focus,Had trouble focusing on the movie with Alex Daddario running around in a tank top gt
2015-05-31 19:32:15,2,0,2,Focus,I actually also recommend Ice Cubes episode of 30 for 30 which focused on the Oakland Raiders NWA is brought up a lot due to them being associated with the brandmerch the Raiders put out and how the controversy surrounding them as a group also started being associated with the team
2015-05-31 20:00:08,7,0,7,Focus,I remember one route the gunman would take where he would slow down a bit at the start With a bit of focus you could take him out before he could get to the mountain range
2015-05-31 20:43:29,1,0,1,Focus,Lost in Translation got me pretty focused
2015-05-31 21:13:57,1,0,1,Focus,I can see this put I thought the blunt force presence of the Bush Administration made it hard to focus on the story just on its own merit
2015-05-31 21:21:33,2,0,2,Focus,Crowd funding movies is the way to go Movie makers need only to please people who want to enjoy the movie instead of having to deal with studio executives producers focus groups ect On top of that it solves the whole pirating issue
2015-05-31 21:44:35,1,0,1,Focus,Kubrick wasnt criticizing with that quote He liked the film You asked how else can the story of the Holocaust be told so I was giving that angle as one example focussing on the pure horror no redemption or humanity shining through which is the normal approach  eg schindlers list life is beautiful
2015-05-31 23:47:45,0,0,0,Focus,My sister and mother  were the breath holders in the group and I was sitting more focused on my Philly cheese steak sandwich at the draft house than the movie    It wasnt bad but not nearly as good as that sandwich
2015-05-05 16:00:24,6,0,6,Insurgent,Divergent didnt get very positive reviews and Insurgent was outright panned
2015-05-07 04:03:00,1,0,1,Insurgent,I try to avoid watching bad movies so I dont have a ton to choose from but I have to say insurgent
2015-05-15 01:24:45,3,0,3,Insurgent,It really is because they want to follow the naming scheme set out by the originals where you have Somenoun of the Planet of the Apes Its not about good or bad its about building brand identity You hear that title and you automatically know its part of the Planet of the Apes series Also its better than all those book adaptations which all get titled The First Books Title Series Second Books Title see Twilight Insurgent Hunger Games etc
2015-05-17 07:21:16,4,0,4,Insurgent,Almost every single iraqi in the movie is an insurgent Edit Not to mention Chris Kyle calling everyone a savage
2015-05-20 06:29:50,-1,0,-1,Insurgent,Interestingly they dont show the Ripsaw tank being destroyed when every other vehicle is It builds suspense but also Im willing to bet the US Military wasnt about to let them show some grubby insurgent with a fuel can and a missing boot destroy their new prototype drone tank platform
2015-05-20 16:39:57,1,0,1,Insurgent,I did this a couple months ago My friend and I screwed up movie times so we couldnt see Kingsmen We decided on Insurgent even though I hadnt seen Divergent yet Watched Divergent a few days later
2015-05-21 00:13:31,1,0,1,Insurgent,Insurgent made you want to watch divergent wut
2015-05-22 20:16:45,1,0,1,Insurgent,httpdivergentscreenreelscom20150521productiononallegiantpart1hasbegun Keep in mind that Part 1 is only filming as one movie which means that it needs to do well in order for Part 2 to happen We need not take it for granted for Batman vs superman opens one week later and is going to PAWN the movie especially since insurgents film did not gross as much as Divergents movie did
2015-05-22 21:42:50,3,0,3,Insurgent,Insurgent I felt no emotion during it and took away nothing after it Its just so similar to everything else in that genre
2015-05-23 03:29:20,1,0,1,Insurgent,Here goes the Link  httpwwwmovie8kusmovie31260watchinsurgentonlinemovie8k
2015-05-25 13:13:55,1,0,1,Insurgent,I forgot Insurgent was a real movie that came out during the year
2015-05-03 16:05:06,2,0,2,The Duff,I feel the same way about Bella Thorne shes only 17 I saw the preview of the movie she was just in The Duff she was 16 during the filming and was kissing Robbie Amells character who was 26 at the time and yes he is cousins with Stephen Amell from Arrow
2015-05-03 20:28:45,2,0,2,The Duff,The Duff
2015-05-05 15:45:16,2,0,2,The Duff,I own the movie and thought it was good and I liked the book too Its a hard book to adapt I didnt like the mist and the way they handled the Dufflepuds But otherwise I thought it was okay
2015-05-25 14:35:23,1,0,1,Piku,Just saw PIKU in theaters Its an Indian movie so Im not sure how wide the release is but every time I pikd inside a theater playing it it was packed mostly with other Indian people I guess thats sort of like checking authenticity if the actual people love it then it must be a great example of an Indian film It was Outstanding dialogue and very natural performances loved the typical mostlyHindi plus a few words of English tossed into a phrase piece Great characters and dynamics lots of fun and pretty hilarious I think anybody could enjoy that film
2015-05-30 14:01:53,5,0,5,Piku,Just watched Piku yesterday
2015-05-01 12:01:11,4,0,4,Mad Max: Fury Road,Im from Scotland so I know The Young Ones and why film titles are changed but the point is not so much that the name has been changed from Young Ones but that it now has Road to Fury as part of its title and its released a little over a week before Mad Max Fury Road comes out
2015-05-08 01:00:57,9,0,9,Mad Max: Fury Road,One does not simply want to see Mad Max Fury Road One must see it Theres just no other option Unless of course youre not interested in Mad Max then its probably not the movie for you and I hope you have a great experience watching a different film thats more to your liking
2015-05-08 06:54:34,1,0,1,Mad Max: Fury Road,Based on a subset of 400 movies from IMDb I calculated the correlation between budget and boxoffice So my prediction for Mad Max Fury Road is  1374545856 Estimated budget is  100000000
2015-05-08 13:28:28,2,0,2,Mad Max: Fury Road,As someone who has already seen Mad Max Fury Road I wouldnt be surprised if it did really well at the box office no spoilers ahead by the way
2015-05-08 23:43:19,1,0,1,Mad Max: Fury Road,Overuse of poorly executed CGI has plagued blockbuster films for the past decade or more Mad Max Fury Road is trying to sell itself as a more practical less cgi feature to meet public demand Obviously there is a lot of computer work being done on the film safety and camera equipment deletes color manipulation tons of comp work etc However the general public doesnt really understand this part of the business What they do understand is Star Wars Episode II Attack of the Clones and how this movie will look nothing like that because of how much of the action was done for real incamera using actual vehicles lots of stunt men and women and an african desert
2015-05-09 19:25:31,1,0,1,Mad Max: Fury Road,I just stated my opinion on the new poster and that I liked it better than the previous posters of Mad Max Fury Road I never started a poster discussion neither mentioned that the cyanorangething is a trend

2015-05-11 14:55:03,13,0,13,Mad Max: Fury Road,I agree but dont worry well have lots and lots of posts about Mad Max Fury Road over the next few weeks
2015-05-11 16:57:24,1,0,1,Mad Max: Fury Road,Thats not the lesson movie execs are going to take from this So yeah Mad Max Fury Road may be the best reboot of an old property in a long time but its competing against Total Recall and Robocop so its pretty much no contest I mean being the one nostalgia flick that doesnt skull fuck you is still a pretty tough sell
2015-05-11 17:42:58,1,0,1,Mad Max: Fury Road,I caught a preview screening of Mad Max Fury Road and I walked away a little underwhelmed Why I think it was because Ive only seen Mad Max but not Road Warrior or Beyond Thunderdome I have a feeling that watching those would have helped me understand a little more about the movie the crazy flashbacks Max has or at least go into this movie knowing what kind of expectations I should have had

2015-05-15 03:28:47,0,0,0,Mad Max: Fury Road,Having sat through the experience of Junkie XLS MAD MAX FURY ROAD His orchestra is drowned out by the typical Hans Zimmer production effects loud sample brass louder sample synth etc which in this context makes less sense than using an orchestra If Junkie XL cut out the garbage over production the grinding cellist would make sense Orchestras know how to make a lot of sounds other than arpeggios and ostinati its that recent scoring trends really dont allow composers to break out of that in order to serve more popular needs in making everything rhythmic and pop sounding but for a society that wouldnt know a casio keyboard if it was strapped to the front of their car it makes very little sense to me Tom Holkenborg used a 40 piece orchestra and I feel like he should have only stuck with that and his array of percussion which in one cue uses a gas tanker container as a mode of inspiration for percussive needs
2015-05-15 04:43:42,0,0,0,Mad Max: Fury Road,Well surely youre aware that women secretly control everything and enslave good nice hardworking protestant middleclass white American males with their evil vaginas and femininefeminist wiles Any time a woman talks about equality you can see the venomous lies dripping from their tongues Its a sinister cabal seeking to emasculate us all by exposing us to such pussified fare as Mad Max Fury Road which will of course eventually lead to a society where all men are rounded up placed in camps and harvested of our precious bodily fluids so as to perpetuate a society which abhors the Y chromosome

2015-05-20 16:37:11,3,0,3,Mad Max: Fury Road,I think that the story while quite simple is compelling in a way that is rare in todays cinema climate In many newer films the stories are convoluted due to the amount of exposition and plot that they are trying to fit into the limited run time In the case of Mad Max Fury Road we are given the information needed to understand the world and characters through the visuals After the brief setup we are thrust into incredible action sequences that put our heroes in peril and make us fear for their survival I think that more than anything you might not understand the love for this movie because the story is largely told through the effects soundtracks chases etc that are completely worthless to you instead of with huge chunks of exposition

2015-05-22 22:34:53,2,0,2,Mad Max: Fury Road,Right now its probably the semiongoing battle of Mad Max Fury Road shocker right Its large scale enough to feel truly epic but you get acquainted with enough characters that it also feels personal The music is also spotfreakingon
2015-05-22 23:08:50,5,0,5,Mad Max: Fury Road,I completely and respectfully disagree If youre going to jump into the middle of a characters story and expect a recap every chapter then youre part of the problem with cinema Unless youre rebooting an entire series or at least read a summary of its plot points it is expected that you are at leat somewhat familiar with the story up to that point I wouldnt jump into Star Wars Episode 7 without having watched the rest of the series so why is Mad Max Fury Road any different Quit expecting to have every plot point served up to you on a silver platter and actually take interest in a series before jumping into the story mid way through and expecting to be led by the hand as to what has happened so far Its crap like this that also wastes time at the start of every single episode of American television I hate reality TV but this sketch seems to sum up American audiences attention span thoroughly httpsyoutube7MFtl2XXnUc

2015-05-23 22:22:31,9,0,9,Mad Max: Fury Road,The question was what are some movies where the hero isnt out the save the world  I saw both Avengers Age of Ultron and Mad Max Fury Road in the same week  Avengers had to stop Ultron to SAVE THE WORLD  Mad Max was really just trying to keep himself from getting killed  He helps people along the way because deep down inside he knows its the right thing to do  I think thats what makes the movies great
2015-05-23 22:50:01,1,0,1,Mad Max: Fury Road,Id say the cult society in Mad Max Fury Road was pretty great  You just get glances of how things work and hear about Gastown and Bulletown  For a balls to the wall action film a lot of thought went into the world

2015-05-24 19:06:02,2,0,2,Mad Max: Fury Road,Mad Max Fury Road because the action is spectacular practical and you can actually tell what the hell is going on The cinematography is beautiful and fits in perfect with the setting The score is psychotic and insane which works for MM FR The worldbuilding is great Mad Max makes you want to see more but with Transformers I honestly couldnt care less about seeing more Finally the biggest difference between them is the acting I cant think of a single good performance in the first Transformersmaybe Turturro comes the closest but in Mad Max all three leads are pretty good aside from Hardys wavering accent but he was still good IMO

2015-05-29 18:20:58,1,0,1,Mad Max: Fury Road,Mad Max Fury Road is the best 80s movie not made in the 80s
2015-05-29 19:13:26,1,0,1,Mad Max: Fury Road,This whole notion of originality is bizarre to me because John Wick which owes its entire aesthetic to classic action movies is praised as original but Mad Max Fury Road isnt just because its the fourth appearance of a character in a franchise with very loose continuity even though its around 30 years since the previous iteration I think Fury Road was one of the most original movies Ive seen in ages not just in premise but how it had no shame and no fear of offending the masses or sponsors etc It went balls to the wall with traditional effects vs cg and characters never stopped to spoon feed formulaic exposition
2015-05-29 20:13:16,3,0,3,Mad Max: Fury Road,Id agree that its a pretty decent movie However he has lost out on a lot of opportunities like Mad Max Fury Road
2015-05-29 20:17:11,1,0,1,Mad Max: Fury Road,While they have great action scenes I will have to disagree that the movies have better showpiece moments  than any other blockbuster in cinema They are very practical but many movies have done before Even a smaller budget movies like The Raid 1 and 2 have more impressive sequences and the second one has better car sequences Someone mentioned that every movie cannot be Mad Max Fury Road Why That is an action movie where action is much more important then story Just like FF7 the story is the weakest part but the action is insanely better As you said beautifully absurd ideas executed to perfection

2015-05-03 11:36:10,1,0,1,The Lazarus Effect,I havent seen The Lazarus Effect 2015 but the trailer certainly looks like Flatliners 1990
2015-05-03 19:25:53,1,0,1,The Lazarus Effect,The Lazarus Effect 2015 is ReAnimator 1985
2015-05-20 13:02:02,1,0,1,The Lazarus Effect,Someone already said Jupiter Ascending so Ill chime in with As Above So Below The Lazarus Effect and The Pyramid were both pretty shitty but nowhere near the sheer terribleness of As Above

2015-05-26 12:15:04,2,0,2,The Lazarus Effect,What disappointed me about Babadook was that I just kept hearing all this talk about how great it was and I didnt read far enough to see that it was yet another paranormal oooh a chair moved type bullshit movie Like I know that its technically not ghosts but thats basically the tone of the movie I put it on expecting to kind of see a horror movie where shit happens and is maybe kind of fun Im embarrassed to say I got more horror fix from The Pyramid and The Lazarus Effect than I did from The Babadook and I think inappropriate expectations had a lot to do with that in conjunction with my sensibilities I dont mind a so deep bro factor in and of itself but I need more than just that
2015-05-28 20:01:21,2,0,2,The Lazarus Effect,uggghhh  I was hoping this was straight horror Did anyone see the Lazarus Effect wduplass Is it worth watching
2015-05-29 01:29:56,5,0,5,The Lazarus Effect,The Lazarus Effect has the honor of being the worst 2015 release Ive seen so far out of 22 films The only thing it had going for it was that it was only 83 minutes

2015-05-26 15:37:57,2,0,2,Do You Believe?,It was among the more inept movies I saw but I had way too much fun with DO YOU BELIEVE to name it as among the worst What a wacky movie Its so uncomfortable and sad to see Sean Astin in these shitty propaganda movies but he really gave his all in his performance as a cad here who is left womanless just like Kevin Sorbo and Dean Cains cads in GODS NOT DEAD My only real disappointment was that there was no appearance from my main man and the films producer BROTHER David AR WHITE
2015-05-03 11:37:56,5,0,5,Paddington,More recently Paddington
2015-05-03 13:57:18,2,0,2,Paddington,Paddington
2015-05-03 15:27:37,6,0,6,Paddington,Paddington  Ive been stressed lately so I want to unwind with something funny and heartwarming Also the BluRay has been sitting unopened since Friday and Ive been eager to see it again
2015-05-08 21:43:47,2,0,2,Paddington,Coming off of the success of Paddington Disney probably thinks they can produce something similarly successful However no matter how similar an apple and an orange might be in size the flavor is still different
2015-05-10 16:59:24,32,0,32,Paddington,Much to my surprise it was Paddington After the insanely good reviews I just really wanted to see how such a bland dull looking film could be so well liked Yeah I get it Its not the next great childrens classic but theres a lot to love it It has a quick postivie sense of humor that keeps the pace up perfectly The voice acting by Ben Whishaw was perfect sweet and funny Other than some cringy song choices mostly the film stays away from frustrating kids movie cliches or at least does them right Its just a funny well made well cast film
2015-05-12 18:56:17,5,0,5,Paddington,Ive only experience two clapping incidents in the UK One was the first showing of one of the Twilights and the other was for Paddington bear The Paddington bear one was exclusively attended by adults so I kind of loved that all these adults getting swept up in a childrens film
2015-05-14 08:26:12,12,0,12,Paddington,Fucking Paddington mate
2015-05-16 10:15:42,2,0,2,Paddington,I loved Paddington as a child I had a teddy bear replica of him with real wellington boots  My mum used to ask Paddington if I could borrow them on rainy days as they fit me just as well as him  Looking forward to watching this new movie when my girlfriend comes over next week
2015-05-16 10:26:38,56,0,56,Paddington,Wow Paddington is really really good Im not sure it beats Toy Story WallE Monsters Inc or Ratatouille for me though
2015-05-16 10:28:44,6,0,6,Paddington,Ratatouille is the weakest out of those youve named WallE is probably the one Pixar movie that could topple Paddington in my eyes I may give it some time and see what I think
2015-05-16 10:51:07,3,0,3,Paddington,Immigrants should behave like Paddington more than wishing the people behave like the Browns and welcome them It was Paddingtons behavior soften Mr Brown and made the Browns behave like they do at the end Paddington listened to cultural learning soundtrack before he entered the boat and he made many goofy mistakes trying to settle down in London but he has the passion to be a good person At the end he shows his heart to the locals which soften the Browns so they love him He became a role model to newcomers
2015-05-16 11:04:59,16,0,16,Paddington,I actually first heard about the Padington movie through this analysishttpswwwfreemovementorgukanimmigrationlawyerreviewspaddington of how his case would be handled under UK immigration rules
2015-05-16 11:38:29,2,0,2,Paddington,Paddington audio bookhttpwwwamazoncomBearCalledPaddingtonMichaelBonddp0060760710 narrated by Stephen Fry
2015-05-16 11:44:20,30,0,30,Paddington,My favourite bit of the whole film is the heartbreakingly ironic line that Paddingtons aunt says when she puts him in the boat to England Its something along the lines of Im sure they wont have forgotten how to treat a stranger
2015-05-16 11:44:50,3,0,3,Paddington,Well that goes back to when Michael Bond conceived of the character he thought of the children back then Mr Gruber was no doubt an invention for the film simply to drive home that point The parallel was always there from Paddington Bears conception though
2015-05-16 11:58:02,24,0,24,Paddington,Why He named four movies and I said Ratatouille is the weakest one named so it cant be better than Paddington And I bloody own Ratatouille on BluRay I love it
2015-05-16 12:07:37,7,0,7,Paddington,I watched the preview clip that was released Paddington in the bathroom making a mess ends with the door breaking down and water flooding out and it looked so awful that I soured me on the entire movie Is that just a bad scene or what
2015-05-16 12:11:06,1,0,1,Paddington,The Paddington books in general do not have an antagonist and as such having an evil character out to kill Paddington was did not work as well as everything else
2015-05-16 15:42:22,-2,0,-2,Paddington,Right It was like the most polite thing Id ever read I kept waiting for Paddington to chimpout
2015-05-16 15:56:07,10,0,10,Paddington,They had to completely redo the voice of  paddington about 6 months before release It was originally supposed to be Colin Firth but everyone agreed it just wasnt right  Turned out well I would say
2015-05-16 15:56:39,3,0,3,Paddington,Im an American that has never read a Paddington Bear book or had even heard of it before the film Will I enjoy this
2015-05-16 16:43:46,3,0,3,Paddington,Yes Paddington does wear the toggled coat in the movie Without giving too much away I can say that the scene where he first dons the coat is pretty special
2015-05-16 17:55:46,8,0,8,Paddington,I agree with the OP Paddington is a perfect family film  truly an allages piece of entertainment The playful visuals are clever and executed with aplomb and I also appreciated the sincere tone You can tell that a lot of care went into making it from a filmmaking team with an earnest respect for the material and the audience
2015-05-16 20:11:05,12,0,12,Paddington,For someone who asked us to gloss over the potential discrepancies in Paddington in the name of magic youre being a bit nitpicky about Ratatouille
2015-05-16 21:53:39,2,0,2,Paddington,I just watched this the other day I really had a few laughs watching it but there was one inconsistency which did put me off a bit spoilers When Paddington is running from Nicole Kidmans character and hes climbing up the chimney she turns up the fire The thing that bothers me here is the motivation for her to capture Paddy Bear is putting him on display in a museum in hope of restoring her fathers honour as an explorer Burning him alive would mean the loss of a unique specimen a risk I dont think Nicole Kidmans character would be willing to take
2015-05-16 22:12:57,1,0,1,Paddington,I never read The Adventures of TinTin bookscomics as a kid but decided to watch the animated movie It was the most amazing movie I have seen in terms of what I was expecting The scene with the tank all one shot moving from one aspect to another Amazing The comedy amazing I absolutely loved that movie and I have heard great things about Paddington As a kid I did love Paddington so hopefully this will exceed expectations
2015-05-17 00:15:50,1,0,1,Paddington,I keep forgetting about this movie I watched Paddington as a kid so Im glad to hear the movie was decent I need to pick it up
2015-05-17 04:34:50,1,0,1,Paddington,I loved Paddington but thought Song of the Sea was better
2015-05-17 05:08:57,0,0,0,Paddington,That movie means a lot to me for reasons Id rather not disclose and Im probably confident in saying that does trump Paddington
2015-05-17 05:21:25,1,0,1,Paddington,Tintin was a fantastic film it was a return to form for Spielberg I hope they continue with the original plan being movie 1 directed by Spielberg 2 directed by Peter Jackson 3 directed by both 2s taking a long time to happen but Id probably blame The Hobbit for all of that I remember reading Peter Jackson would begin work on Tintin 2 after finishing the Hobbit films Fingers crossed And I hope you enjoy Paddington when you watch it All the best
2015-05-17 05:25:02,1,0,1,Paddington,Thats actually a good point but as you saw it was more of a trap she ended up on the roof in the end and wanted to corner Paddington That scene is fantastically tense though I was breathing so fast
2015-05-17 11:46:38,1,0,1,Paddington,I thought it looked shit I thought Paddington looked horrendous
2015-05-18 13:53:22,21,0,21,Paddington,You should watch Paddington  She seems to suffer from some sort of illness called embarrassment

2015-05-31 12:40:58,5,0,5,Paddington,Paddington The trailers made it look like schlock that only a sixyearold could sit through What I saw instead was an endlessly charming family movie that warmed the heart and appealed to adults on multiple levels
2015-05-31 18:27:57,2,0,2,Paddington,Uff I mean yesss theres parts they could enjoy but theres an offscreen death within five minutes and the main conflict is a taxidermist wants to skin Paddington and stuff him for display in a museum I dont have any kids of my own but those aspects sounds a little heavy for a threeyearold to me Id be thinking more like seven or eight
2015-05-01 15:21:02,1,0,1,Jupiter Ascending,Im hopeful but not optimistic Ive not seen a breakthrough performance by Channing Tatum I have no confidence in the screenwriter because of the terrible script for Prometheus All of this being said I dont understand why people did not enjoy Jupiter Ascending more Though the film was formulaic and derivative SF it was a great popcorn movie and visually stunning
2015-05-03 00:40:36,6,0,6,Jupiter Ascending,Jupiter Ascending It looks very nice but the story is rubbish
2015-05-03 01:19:12,1,0,1,Jupiter Ascending,Jupiter Ascending and Man of Steel have both been shot in all of the neighboring towns right around me
2015-05-03 16:10:48,55,0,55,Jupiter Ascending,i really hoped jupiter ascending would be this amazing new space opera franchise holy shit was i wrong
2015-05-03 19:31:06,2,0,2,Jupiter Ascending,I think hes good in Jupiter Ascending
2015-05-03 23:17:09,1,0,1,Jupiter Ascending,I was the same  I absolutely love Cloud Atlas but Jupiter Ascending was just a big letdown
2015-05-03 23:47:08,7,0,7,Jupiter Ascending,You need to get off the antiTatum train because hes proven to be a good actor Go watch Foxcatcher Magic Mike Side Effects role was short and he was even good at Jupiter Ascending despite the trainweck of a movie it was
2015-05-04 01:29:56,2,0,2,Jupiter Ascending,how did you feel about Jupiter Ascending
2015-05-04 01:46:40,3,0,3,Jupiter Ascending,When the hero always has to save the girl at exactly the last second Jupiter Ascending was particularly egregious about this in a number of scenes and I think Channing Tatum saved her at the absolute last moment at least 3 times over the entire movie

2015-05-06 00:17:59,2,0,2,Jupiter Ascending,The first three movies that were just released to buy digital American Sniper Fifty Shades of Grey and Jupiter Ascending are all missing from the Direct to Home list This website does not seem to be very good
2015-05-06 23:11:03,1,0,1,Jupiter Ascending,The only thing I really noticed about Jupiter Ascending was how consistently shitty it was
2015-05-07 02:01:24,1,0,1,Jupiter Ascending,Same with Jupiter Ascending Truly dreadful film but the trailer uses a track called Natus Vincere which is absolutely incredible I was waiting for it to occur in the film but it didnt and instead the whole film had your typical generic actionfantasy soundtrack

2015-05-07 19:52:33,1,0,1,Jupiter Ascending,Id say Jupiter Ascending delivered on its concept though The problem most people have with it is that its concept is campy overthetop CGIheavy space opera
2015-05-07 21:26:24,4,0,4,Jupiter Ascending,4 Hours ago somebody posted about Jupiter Ascending herehttpwwwredditcomrmoviescomments357193watched_jupiter_ascending_last_night so I will just quote what I wrote
2015-05-07 21:30:13,1,0,1,Jupiter Ascending,Jupiter Ascending should have been a simple movie like Transformers but they tried to make it complex and failed at almost everything At least the CGI was well done but it didnt help overall
2015-05-07 21:51:52,1,0,1,Jupiter Ascending,Jupiter Ascending was one failed creschendo after another and a series of sequences that take 5 minutes to play out in the movie but should only be several seconds in movie time
2015-05-07 23:45:06,1,0,1,Jupiter Ascending,You have to remember that Cloud Atlas wasnt as big of a hit as everyone was hoping I personally loved it but everyone trashed it That means they were probably on a much tighter leash with Jupiter Ascending
2015-05-08 09:55:09,1,0,1,Jupiter Ascending,While it would be nice to know what you thought about it in detail so that this discussions has some direction I will say that I enjoyed this movie It is one that I revisit quite a lot strangely enough While about could be said about its failings I can say that when taken at a visual level it is a glorious look into a bright neon co poured fever dream of childhood Where everything is saturated the milk is extra cold everything is over the top and its always Saturday morning The final moments of that final race always leaves a smile on my face The directors have always been so adept visually and their films always have such interesting ideas littered everywhere this is a reason why while I see the flaws in Jupiter ascending I still enjoy what they put a cross visually
2015-05-08 16:21:58,3,0,3,Jupiter Ascending,He was also in the Oscar nominated Foxcatcher so I dont see how doing bad movies automatically means you assume theyll ruin things Eddie Redmayne won best actor but was in Jupiter Ascending and Matthew McConaughey won best actor was in countless terrible romantic comedy movies
2015-05-08 20:07:03,1,0,1,Jupiter Ascending,And Jupiter Ascending refers to a girl
2015-05-08 22:17:40,5,0,5,Jupiter Ascending,Jupiter Ascending After regaining her title as galactic empress she goes back to cleaning toilets back on Earth keeping her now safe again family oblivious and happy showing they all love each other Bonus shes now got Channing Tatum and sky rollerblades

2015-05-09 05:31:04,0,0,0,Jupiter Ascending,Last few days just constant posts about Jupiter Ascending All of them either shit on it as a boring mess or say that it was underrated and theres nothing wrong with it Everyone thinks their opinion is extremely important
2015-05-09 07:08:05,9,0,9,Jupiter Ascending,After just having finally seen Guardians of the GalaxyJupiter Ascending is like the bargain bin 4 for 10 version
2015-05-09 07:17:28,9,0,9,Jupiter Ascending,How did the same directors make the steaming pile that is Jupiter Ascending
2015-05-10 05:34:31,1,0,1,Jupiter Ascending,In February the studios dump the real turkeys  If a movie is originally scheduled between early spring and late fall and it gets moved to February you know the studio is dumping a real bomb  This happened to Jupiter Ascending so everyone knew to avoid it
2015-05-10 08:32:22,35,0,35,Jupiter Ascending,Jupiter Ascending More like Wachowskis fucking suck amirite httpconcjohnnythemidgetcomyawnzorimagesfuny20imaeg20macero20gifs203Bpjay_sherman_it_stinksjpg

2015-05-10 16:01:04,1,0,1,Jupiter Ascending,Original looks fairly generic but then I have only seen the trailers  It also looks like Jupiter Ascending  But not as bad
2015-05-10 17:16:03,4,0,4,Jupiter Ascending,Watched Jupiter Ascending with the boyfriend this weekend Its not a great movie itll never win an oscar but its visually stunning Its brainless mindless eye candy with explosions and space ships I liked it
2015-05-10 17:42:06,1,0,1,Jupiter Ascending,saw It Follows and also Jupiter Ascending
2015-05-10 21:11:16,77,0,77,Jupiter Ascending,Eddie Redmayne hams it up in Jupiter Ascending Hes the best part of the movie
2015-05-10 21:30:18,5,0,5,Jupiter Ascending,When people say Jupiter Ascending is bad I wonder if they look away during his scenes Hes practically magnetic
2015-05-10 23:45:01,1,0,1,Jupiter Ascending,I simply could not understand why people were excited for or even interested in Jupiter Ascending
2015-05-11 01:32:47,2,0,2,Jupiter Ascending,The Big Dumb Scifi Fun Marathon John Carter Jupiter Ascending Guardians of the Galaxy Pacific Rim
2015-05-11 03:34:58,7,0,7,Jupiter Ascending,I cant believe she was the lead in Jupiter Ascending All I heard was Meg when I closed my eyes She doesnt have that sort of drive behind her that makes for a good compelling main character She always seems to just be herself and not very dramatic
2015-05-11 06:19:58,1,0,1,Jupiter Ascending,I love the Matrix franchise but I think its dead in the water I doubt Warner will ever gamble on it again and the Wachowskis pretty much killed their credibility with Jupiter Ascending
2015-05-11 17:01:10,1,0,1,Jupiter Ascending,This movie will fail solely because of the trailers  I fully understand that many here loved the trailers and are excited for the movie but for everyone else the trailerscommercials have doomed this movie in the theaters  The same thing happened most recently with movies like Edge of Tomorrow and Jupiter Ascending the trailers were too much and did not make any sense as to what the movie is about
2015-05-11 18:16:07,2,0,2,Jupiter Ascending,Im with you 100 I loved Cloud Atlas and Jupiter Ascending They had flaws sure but the films are filled with this hightened level of imagination than other films They are really inspiring simply because I can feel the work that was put into them I never feel like they halfassed the film just were held back by studio restrictions or a lack of funding They really try to do the best with what they have and make movies no one would dare ever make I very much appreciate how hard they work at making unique films
2015-05-11 19:04:54,1,0,1,Jupiter Ascending,The only film I have seen this week is Jupiter Ascending and apart from special effects I did not like it one bit Mila Kunis was really irritating
2015-05-11 22:57:22,3,0,3,Jupiter Ascending,Jupiter Ascending wouldve been out today too if WB hadnt pushed it backI still have the reservation at my FYE No reason they cant honor it in like a month
2015-05-12 01:36:06,1,0,1,Jupiter Ascending,Robbie Collin is probably my favourite critic writing today Really fun evocative descriptions without ever losing sight of the bigger picture and going on blind rants Also nice to see a professional critic with media literacy beyond film  such as when he compared Jupiter Ascendings action sequences to a mix between Bayonetta and Jet Set Radio Future

2015-05-12 19:41:48,43,0,43,Jupiter Ascending,I liked Jupiter Ascending Redmayne  Dial that shit up
2015-05-12 22:21:00,25,0,25,Jupiter Ascending,After watching him in Jupiter Ascending he had a very Voldemorty vibe goin on I can definitely see him as a bad guy
2015-05-12 23:41:52,16,0,16,Jupiter Ascending,I hated him in Jupiter Ascendingcourse I really didnt like Jupiter Ascending as a movie I normally enjoy the Wakowski films
2015-05-13 00:11:20,20,0,20,Jupiter Ascending,Yeahhhh I wanted to punch him in the face in every scene he was in in Jupiter Ascending Jeez that movie sucked so hard
2015-05-13 02:21:24,0,0,0,Jupiter Ascending,i think he was terRIBLE IN JUPITER ASCENDING
2015-05-13 06:59:31,14,0,14,Jupiter Ascending,He was awful in Jupiter ascending His Botoxlip fillers didnt let his mouth move and the weird whisper delivery was terrible
2015-05-13 11:56:27,0,0,0,Jupiter Ascending,Jupiter ascending was hilariously terrible It was like a high budget version of the room except less coherent In the very beginning it was cut and dried ScifiHarry potter where a normal hard working girl finds out shes part of a secret world Then action movieindependence day with the big fight scene and weirdly powerful aliens with ill defined abilities that are still quite easily defeatable by a single character with ill defined abilities Then Men in Black when everyone didnt remember the space battle over Chicago happening Then Bee Movie but with Sean Bean taking the lead role instead of Jerry Seinfeld Including classic lines such as you can trust bees bees never lie Then it got strange The next sequence was the best a Scifi fantasy gilliamesque adventure through a space bureaucracy to become one of what must be hundreds of thousands of space royals a very intriguing and delightful premise Next comes a touching homage from the Wachowskis to themselves and we see something from The Matrix as humans on earth are unbeknownst to themselves being farmed for the use of more advanced intelligence Then it lost any vaguely coherent theme or thread and drew to a close at an incredibly slow rate Leaning towards a Shrek like finish wherein the main character almost marries a villain but is stopped at the last second by a dashing ogre or a dashing space lycanthrope Then mercifully its all ogre
2015-05-13 13:18:48,1,0,1,Jupiter Ascending,There are a lot of varied opinions on that film Most are bad but I really really dug it Jupiter Ascending tapped into a side of fantastical story telling that I just dont see anymore and I truly enjoyed it even for all its flaws
2015-05-13 16:17:46,1,0,1,Jupiter Ascending,As long as its better than jupiter ascending we should be good
2015-05-14 16:59:36,1,0,1,Jupiter Ascending,Seeing Mad Max Fury Road in IMAX tomorrow and prob seeing Star Wars Force Awakens in IMAX as well Also saw Jupiter Ascending in IMAX already this year
2015-05-14 17:14:30,0,0,0,Jupiter Ascending,I guess the best way to watch Jupiter ascending would have been IMAX The movie was terrible but it looked amazing I have the IMAX poster up in my room
2015-05-15 18:09:33,1,0,1,Jupiter Ascending,All his movies were cheaper then Jupiter Ascending and most of them lt100M For Holywood he is a budget directior
2015-05-15 20:49:48,2,0,2,Jupiter Ascending,How do you make Cloud Atlas which was great IMHO and then move on to something like Jupiter Ascending I get that some films are hard acts to follow but that pushes the limit
2015-05-16 02:11:00,1,0,1,Jupiter Ascending,I really wonder Jupiter Ascending is the worst film theyve done in my opinion Its one thing to make bad movies but its another to make boring movies
2015-05-17 10:28:17,2,0,2,Jupiter Ascending,Thats almost pretty much the plot to Jupiter Ascending
2015-05-17 18:00:13,1,0,1,Jupiter Ascending,For me the effect only really showed a couple of times when things were whizzing at my face but thats been with 3D movies in general for meI recall seeing Jupiter Ascending in IMAX 3D and the best 3D was a trailer for a nature documentary before it P So I dont know if this is an issue of mine or what but 95 of the time I ususally feel like m watching a 2D movie
2015-05-18 13:00:53,2,0,2,Jupiter Ascending,I subscribed but you are dead wrong about Jupiter Ascending That movie is stupid fun Stupid but fun
2015-05-18 14:30:39,1,0,1,Jupiter Ascending,Jupiter Ascending So much action Great concept And graphics
2015-05-18 18:01:37,1,0,1,Jupiter Ascending,Jupiter Ascending
2015-05-19 18:15:36,-6,0,-6,Jupiter Ascending,I loved Jupiter Ascending and will readily defend the hell out of it I found it fun exhilarating and joyous It was unashamed of its own mad ideas and went with them exploring some really fascinating concepts alongside whambam action scenes It has problems the editing is horribly choppy in places but theyre far overwhelmed by the films strengths  a great world a deep mythology and boundless imagination And did I mention that its absolutely gorgeous The production design is excuse the clich out of this world
2015-05-19 19:36:02,1,0,1,Jupiter Ascending,I still love you Jupiter Ascending and I dont care who knows
2015-05-19 19:47:52,12,0,12,Jupiter Ascending,100 this Like you I really enjoyed Jupiter Ascending I found it incredibly refreshing and admire it deeply for the risks it took in terms of its storytelling choices and worldbuilding It was deeply ambitious and I think it turned mainstream audiences off because it simply tried to do too much  it established a whole new world from the bottom up and showed us a great deal of it and I think it caused your average filmgoer to zone out They couldnt deal with the film so rejected it as stupid and ludicrous
2015-05-19 20:07:38,1,0,1,Jupiter Ascending,I really liked Jupiter Ascending It was an original scifi with a plot and art style that wasnt afraid to be unique Ya its more fantasy scifi but I think we could use more of that The mood they set and all the scifi environmentscharacters were badass Not meant to be taken seriously like interstellar or something I think people are being way too hard on this movie
2015-05-19 20:54:11,-3,0,-3,Jupiter Ascending,The Last Airbender is Citizen Kane compared to Jupiter Ascending
2015-05-19 21:41:54,0,0,0,Jupiter Ascending,Battlefield Earth wasnt fun bad That was bad bad I couldnt even finish watching it Jupiter Ascending is fun bad tho
2015-05-19 21:58:07,2,0,2,Jupiter Ascending,I loved cloud atlas and thought speed racer was great too I havent seen jupiter ascending yet but I dont doubt that Ill enjoy it too
2015-05-19 22:08:18,3,0,3,Jupiter Ascending,Itd probably be better if you muted Jupiter Ascending and played the audio for Battlefield Earth over it
2015-05-19 22:42:06,1,0,1,Jupiter Ascending,I take it you really hate Jupiter Ascending eh Well what are some movies that you like
2015-05-19 23:16:00,-1,0,-1,Jupiter Ascending,I actually liked Jupiter Ascending Like thoroughly enjoyed it
2015-05-19 23:38:52,-14,0,-14,Jupiter Ascending,Really I thought it was horrible Super slow and zero payoff By far the worst thing Ive watched this year that wasnt Jupiter Ascending
2015-05-20 00:10:30,1,0,1,Jupiter Ascending,Channing Tatum was the long bright spot in Jupiter Ascending Other than him the movie truly sucked ass The world building was fantastic along with the effects but the rest was just pure shit
2015-05-20 00:31:29,3,0,3,Jupiter Ascending,Ive asked this one hundred times and never gotten a response but does anyone notice a similarity between Jupiter Ascending and Tetsuwan Birdy
2015-05-20 00:47:50,1,0,1,Jupiter Ascending,If any of you guys saw the new Annietheres a fake scifi movie Annie and Jamie Foxx go see It was purposefully terrible and looked just like Jupiter Ascending
2015-05-20 01:03:01,1,0,1,Jupiter Ascending,I enjoyed Jupiter Ascending  But then I also like Alien 3
2015-05-20 01:47:44,4,0,4,Jupiter Ascending,Mila Kunis cannot carry a scifi space opera She isnt a dramatic actor Sure she can star in a more real world drama and work out fine but she doesnt have that  theatrical over the top personality to stand out in something like Jupiter Ascending The movie wasnt good but her flat acting definitely did it a disservice in a scifi world full of overacting operatic figures
2015-05-20 02:13:37,3,0,3,Jupiter Ascending,going off of a 120 minute run time movie the acts are usually set up with the first act ending after the first thirty minutes the second act lasting an hour and the third act being the last thirty minute First act should end with the goal being revealed The second act should end with some event that makes it seem like its impossible to reach that goal And the third act should be the characters reaching that goal at all odds I havent seen Jupiter Ascending but if the second act ends with Jupiter being rescued by Wolfman guy so that she can assume earths throne or whatever and the third act ends with Jupiter being rescued by Wolfman guy so that she could assume the throne of earth or whatever then the screenwriters didnt do their job right I would suggest checking out Syd Fields Foundations of Screenwriting if youd like to advance past simple minded caveman
2015-05-20 02:37:54,1,0,1,Jupiter Ascending,Jupiter Ascending certainly looks like a beautiful movie judging from this honest trailer Looks like it could have actually been a good movie if the script wasnt apparently so shitty
2015-05-20 02:57:53,2,0,2,Jupiter Ascending,I really liked jupiter ascending Give it a chance it may surprise you
2015-05-20 03:02:51,20,0,20,Jupiter Ascending,When I first read about the movie it was billed as the first in a trilogy shot concurrently by some of the film industry media Although now that it hasnt been well received I dont know if well ever see the final two Even the title Jupiter Ascending seems like the first of others Jupiter Eclipsed Jupiter Avenging Once we heard that earth could be harvested according to the rules of good scifi plot you know someone WILL try to harvest it Big evil corporation is just going to let her have the earth I dont think so  I think it was supposed to play out like this Film 1 Meet Jupiter and her ragtag band of allies and enemies Wow space scifi is cool Look at all the costumes and CG Film 2 Redmayne is not dead just injured and really angry Maybe has to accept a new bionic body part  Jupiter defends the earth from harvest with help from intergalactic rebels and the bees The pill that space boyfriend had Jupiter swallow int he first movie is actually a locator beacon that helps the good guys find her when she is lured off somewhere to die at the hands of the evil space siblings At some point a trusted character who you thought was all nice betrays Jupiter Maybe the bee guy  because of his sick daughter But then redeems himself by dying to save Jupiter at the last minute so Jupiter will somehow save his daughter One of the other ruling space siblings dies for real this time A shocked and awed earth populous survived the aliens and Jupiter becomes a bit of a celebrity on her home planet Film 3 Jupiter solves the mystery of who killed her predecessor and why and somehow uses sick daughter of bee guy to take down the rest of the ruling family using her space virus Or imploding a sun at their home world and then cures the daughter and the afflicted populous of the galaxy Aha the sickness was manufactured on purpose to keep the universe buying the family corporations product but Space Mama had a change of heart so her daughter killed her to stay rich Jupiter become benevolent empress of the universe while resolving the other characters side issues PS hybrid sky skates boyfriend is also secretly some kind of other space royalty despite of his spliced nature Jupiter helps liberate his people and the spliced underclass elevating them to the status of real people They might unsplice sky skates boyfriend beauty and the beast style for a happy ending or maybe just leave him as he is Earth is not alone anymore and the aliens are now all cool and groovy and Space boyfriend wants to show Jupiter the rest of the universe They sail off into the cosmic sunset The End
2015-05-20 04:48:38,1,0,1,Jupiter Ascending,If you had the jupiter ascending masters jonah hill and a wire team and greenscreen you could probably replace mila in the whole movie it would be glorious
2015-05-20 04:56:22,2,0,2,Jupiter Ascending,Id see any movie Tina Belcher would write tbh That character is authentic to the awkward teenage girl experience and I think thats part of why Jupiter Ascending was so rad to me Middle school fantasies exploded onto the screen with millions of dollars in special effects The film we deserve
2015-05-20 05:03:29,0,0,0,Jupiter Ascending,lol you liked Jupiter Ascending
2015-05-20 05:19:04,1,0,1,Jupiter Ascending,I saw Jupiter ascending the light beam about 24 minutes in What was the rest of it about
2015-05-20 05:49:59,1,0,1,Jupiter Ascending,Wait how is nobody mentioning V for Vendetta I know they didnt direct it but that was an AWESOMELY written movie That should more than make up for the drivel they put in Jupiter Ascending
2015-05-20 06:09:41,1,0,1,Jupiter Ascending,Dune Although they tried with Jupiter Ascending and that was pretty flawed so it might as well just stay dormant
2015-05-20 07:21:12,1,0,1,Jupiter Ascending,While I havent ever seen Jupiter Ascending i can agree that subtitles and a language a cant understand makes me believe everyone is a great actor I have a lot of fun watching foreign films for this reason
2015-05-20 09:59:29,4,0,4,Jupiter Ascending,You sir are being completely unfair to even mention Temple of Doom in the same thread as Jupiter Ascending
2015-05-20 11:55:03,7,0,7,Jupiter Ascending,Jupiter Ascending comes to mind
2015-05-20 12:06:27,1,0,1,Jupiter Ascending,But that has nothing to do though with the topic at hand here Jupiter Ascending and past good Wachowski movies
2015-05-20 13:02:02,1,0,1,Jupiter Ascending,Someone already said Jupiter Ascending so Ill chime in with As Above So Below The Lazarus Effect and The Pyramid were both pretty shitty but nowhere near the sheer terribleness of As Above
2015-05-20 14:12:24,3,0,3,Jupiter Ascending,Cant remember last year but for 2015 the worst film is Hot Pursuit thus far And Ive seen Jupiter Ascending and 50 Shades as well
2015-05-20 20:02:56,9,0,9,Jupiter Ascending,Where does Cloud Atlas Jupiter Ascending or Speed Racer have any Manson imagery
2015-05-20 21:21:52,4,0,4,Jupiter Ascending,I just watched Jupiter Ascending on a flight saw the woman in the middle seat was watching my film no headphones on I said to her Its a beautiful film It makes no sense Youre probably getting the better experience
2015-05-21 02:35:07,1,0,1,Jupiter Ascending,Long Live Jupiter Ascending
2015-05-21 03:40:06,1,0,1,Jupiter Ascending,Ex Machina would really suck and Jupiter Ascending would have likeable characters
2015-05-21 04:20:24,1,0,1,Jupiter Ascending,I think they took it way to easy on Jupiter Ascending
2015-05-21 04:55:51,1,0,1,Jupiter Ascending,The setupforeshadowing is all there in Jupiter Ascending if you look for it I just fleshed it out In a good film no incidental comment is there just because Every second cost about 23000 to make so it should all have meaning My experience of previous Wachowskis work is that they are very detailoriented and minor dialogue and events can have big consequences later on
2015-05-21 06:47:30,1,0,1,Jupiter Ascending,I find this one the best of all the Jupiter Ascending Promotional Posters httpwwwicepostercompostersmoviesJupiter_Ascending_movie_posters_28201429MOV_359e36f6_Jupiter_Ascending_movie_poster_28201429_Posterhtml
2015-05-21 16:52:53,4,0,4,Jupiter Ascending,Jupiter Ascending  despite only watching the first 20 minutes  surprised I got that far to be honest I had to watch the honest trailer to find out what the plot was
2015-05-21 19:46:33,3,0,3,Jupiter Ascending,Jupiter Ascending had a plot
2015-05-21 21:28:28,1,0,1,Jupiter Ascending,Looking at IMDB the only ones Ive seen from 2015 are Mad Max Fury Road and Jupiter Ascending So its those two I guess
2015-05-22 03:40:03,1,0,1,Jupiter Ascending,Jupiter Ascending comes to mind
2015-05-22 13:49:55,67,0,67,Jupiter Ascending,Every scene in Jupiter Ascending
2015-05-23 03:03:20,-1,0,-1,Jupiter Ascending,Dumbest thing I have ever seen Just as bad asJupiter ascending
2015-05-23 04:14:14,1,0,1,Jupiter Ascending,Jupiter Ascending as runner up
2015-05-23 13:35:19,2,0,2,Jupiter Ascending,fuck he looks so stupid in that trailer i thought it was a scifi flick or some shit borderline channing tatum in jupiter ascending stupid looking
2015-05-23 15:46:03,2,0,2,Jupiter Ascending,I liked the style  But more of a vehicle  I absolutely  love the universe of Jupiter Ascending  But it had to much going on  But i want more movies that stand alone And take risks
2015-05-24 03:17:29,1,0,1,Jupiter Ascending,Jupiter Ascending anything by the Watchowski siblings
2015-05-24 04:44:37,2,0,2,Jupiter Ascending,actually apparently he didnt die in Jupiter Ascending
2015-05-24 04:46:30,1,0,1,Jupiter Ascending,Not Jupiter Ascending apparently
2015-05-24 05:55:26,2,0,2,Jupiter Ascending,If he dies itll be a good movie if he doesnt we could end up with another Jupiter Ascending
2015-05-24 11:08:46,1,0,1,Jupiter Ascending,I thought Green Hornet was horrible Almost walked out of that one Jupiter Ascending was also a bad one
2015-05-24 14:41:34,7,0,7,Jupiter Ascending,Jupiter Ascending
2015-05-24 14:41:44,-1,0,-1,Jupiter Ascending,In Jupiter Ascending he didnt die OH SHIT SPOILER
2015-05-24 15:54:39,2,0,2,Jupiter Ascending,Jonah Hex and Jupiter Ascending Good lord
2015-05-25 01:54:56,-2,0,-2,Jupiter Ascending,Below 50 because literally every movie that my friend hyped up for us has ended up receiving a rotten score or fresh score but been disappointing Jupiter Ascending Dracula Untold Transformers 4 Tomorrowland Hobbit BotFA Exodus Gods and Kings Godzilla and Amazing SpiderMan 2
2015-05-25 13:49:19,1,0,1,Jupiter Ascending,Jupiter Ascending Sure its a bit all over the place and fine the story has some holes in it but its campy fun Its as if someone decided to film a really crazy fanfiction and thats what makes it great
2015-05-25 18:15:50,1,0,1,Jupiter Ascending,Hopefully this will be a better original property than Jupiter Ascending xD
2015-05-25 18:59:15,1,0,1,Jupiter Ascending,Dog ears or any makeup infuck it all of Jupiter ascending
2015-05-25 21:52:08,7,0,7,Jupiter Ascending,Hot Tub Time Machine 2 Black Hat Project Almanac and Jupiter Ascending IMHO I didnt bother with Paul Blart 2  it looked awful
2015-05-25 22:04:26,14,0,14,Jupiter Ascending,Jupiter Ascending was almost amazingly bad But it was just bad
2015-05-26 00:11:18,6,0,6,Jupiter Ascending,Blackhat wasnt that bad especially compared to garbage like Jupiter Ascending and HTTM2
2015-05-26 01:20:01,3,0,3,Jupiter Ascending,Oh fuck off sorry I didnt pay to go see Jupiter Ascending Taken 3 Paul Blart 2 Hot Pursuit or Hot Tub Time Machine 2 because they looked like ass and everyone said they were ass and I wasnt interested in them I tend to spend my money on movies I think Ill enjoy because Im not a moron I thought Id enjoy Avengers 2 and I didnt Sorry
2015-05-26 01:50:49,-6,0,-6,Jupiter Ascending,Jupiter Ascending wasnt meant to be serious Its pure escapism thats very much in on the joke
2015-05-26 06:23:00,23,0,23,Jupiter Ascending,I was actually thinking Jupiter Ascending
2015-05-26 07:02:01,44,0,44,Jupiter Ascending,There were so many things Jupiter Ascending did badly the romantic subplot kinda gets overlooked
2015-05-26 13:45:55,1,0,1,Jupiter Ascending,Jupiter Ascending had terrible boring exposition scenes In fact its probably everything this thread is against
2015-05-26 14:04:39,6,0,6,Jupiter Ascending,I think the big issue with Jupiter Ascending was the complete lack of chemistry between Tatum and Kunis And also the poor dialogue But if they had had some sort of just anything to go off of it would have made more sense They just didnt click well together to me
2015-05-27 12:58:31,2,0,2,Jupiter Ascending,To answer ops question Id say yes But the example Im using will be from the opposite direction Jupiter Ascending Instead of a trilogy that would have been better as two movies this is a single movie that would could have been better as two
2015-05-28 17:12:42,0,0,0,Jupiter Ascending,Im not sure if they are getting worse or they were just never that good in the first place  The Matrix is fantastic but almost everything else is below average  Reloaded was okay Revolutions was bad  Speed Racer was awful  Cloud Atlas was not great  I didnt even watch Jupiter Ascending because I assumed it would be bad  Seems like I guessed correctly  What a shame  I love The Matrix so much Part of me wants another sequel but the other half knows better
2015-05-28 19:46:23,1,0,1,Jupiter Ascending,Jupiter Ascending
2015-05-28 20:40:49,17,0,17,Jupiter Ascending,Did they see Jupiter ascending
2015-05-28 22:55:32,-8,0,-8,Jupiter Ascending,But Jupiter Ascending is more comparable as a movie than those other ones
2015-05-29 00:15:04,0,0,0,Jupiter Ascending,Its like they all saw Jupiter Ascending and said That guy cant lead shit
2015-05-29 04:52:25,1,0,1,Jupiter Ascending,Depends on my expectations for the film to begin with I didnt expect Jupiter Ascending to be good after reading reviews and still went and saw it in 3D
2015-05-29 05:16:37,2,0,2,Jupiter Ascending,i think jupiter ascending was more a fault on the wachowskis than it was channing tatum
2015-05-29 08:09:55,1,0,1,Jupiter Ascending,I worked on a previzconcept video for this last year  The guy playing Gambit in the video was Tatums stunt double on 21 Jump Street and Jupiter Ascending
2015-05-29 10:27:42,3,0,3,Jupiter Ascending,Jupiter Ascending It had cool ideas and was inventive but it was just embarrassing
2015-05-29 14:20:41,178,0,178,Jupiter Ascending,Just swinging by long enough to say I went to the cinema to see Jupiter Ascending
2015-05-29 14:23:09,5,0,5,Jupiter Ascending,And the original film needs to be good Cant blame anyone who didnt pay to see Jupiter Ascending or Tomorrowland
2015-05-29 14:28:09,52,0,52,Jupiter Ascending,Yeah I do support original movies I saw Princess and the Frog Wreck It Ralph Tangled Big Hero 6 Jupiter Ascending Gravity
2015-05-29 14:46:43,2,0,2,Jupiter Ascending,Jupiter Ascending was original and fucking terrible  If we want original films they should make better ones
2015-05-29 15:08:23,1,0,1,Jupiter Ascending,I saw it last night before I looked at the reviews I think the 14 on rotten tomatoes is not deserved and it should be closer to 50 The movie wasnt terrible but I thought Jupiter Ascending was worse and that got 25
2015-05-29 15:19:28,1,0,1,Jupiter Ascending,Didnt someone write this exact article about Jupiter Ascending  Dont scold the audience for not liking your garbage movie  Make a better movie
2015-05-29 15:41:18,0,0,0,Jupiter Ascending,Exactly how I feel about Jupiter ascending watch the honest trailer for it if you are want to know what it is about
2015-05-29 15:46:52,2,0,2,Jupiter Ascending,People were making the same bull shit argument for Jupiter Ascending As if whatever ounce of originality that movie had could possibly redeem it
2015-05-29 16:45:09,2,0,2,Jupiter Ascending,If you want original films to make money you have to make good original films  Not like Tomorrowland and Jupiter Ascending
2015-05-29 17:15:21,3,0,3,Jupiter Ascending,I watched Jupiter Ascending yesterday without really knowing anything about it as I just saw it was streaming for me I really liked the idea cast was good but it felt a bit empty
2015-05-29 17:19:48,3,0,3,Jupiter Ascending,Dont worry about him His analogy is backwards If you saw Jupiter Ascending in the theater you are the victim not the molester
2015-05-29 17:50:46,1,0,1,Jupiter Ascending,no matter how you feel about the movie itself or its performance in the box office Jupiter Ascending should be in your list
2015-05-29 18:06:14,1,0,1,Jupiter Ascending,I dont know the exact numbers but it seems like original films have been on the rise in the last few years Granted the quality varies but off the top of my head Grand Budapest Hotel Tomorrowland Ex Machina John Wick  The Raid Redemption Unfriended Frozen Transcendence Earth to Echo Interstellar Chappie The Man with the Iron Fists Green Inferno Tammy Jupiter Ascending Pixels The Hateful Eight etc Like I said varying quality and I guess success but mostly successful
2015-05-29 18:39:08,1,0,1,Jupiter Ascending,Jupiter Ascending was also an original idea
2015-05-29 23:46:33,1,0,1,Jupiter Ascending,Pretty much this I thought Jupiter Ascending would be better and Seventh Sons too but neither were that good The second is slightly more fun but thats about it
2015-05-29 23:47:47,0,0,0,Jupiter Ascending,Having just sat down and watched Jupiter Ascending with my girlfriend I am honestly glad I didnt pay to see it in theaters The effects and aliens were all very very well done but the plot was paper thin and pretty mehworthy
2015-05-29 23:51:02,0,0,0,Jupiter Ascending,If youre like me whos open to action movies especially SciFi regardless of being bad and just want to have fun watching it then id recommend Jupiter Ascending Its not a good movie but the action sequences were good and the storyline was really incoherent and seemed like they focused on the designs and visuals more
2015-05-29 23:59:38,-1,0,-1,Jupiter Ascending,Jupiter Ascending has a really cool universe If you ignore the Queen toilet cleaner and the Dog boy with space roller blades it isnt terrible
2015-05-30 01:08:47,0,0,0,Jupiter Ascending,I can only comment on Jupiter Ascending Its hype was overplayed Im not saying it was the worst movie but it was definitely a nono in my pile of movies
2015-05-30 01:18:25,1,0,1,Jupiter Ascending,Jupiter Rising Is that some porn spinoff of Jupiter Ascending
2015-05-30 01:24:58,1,0,1,Jupiter Ascending,Im sad that Jupiter Ascending wasnt a hit I loved that crazy space wizard of oz
2015-05-30 16:23:27,-2,0,-2,Jupiter Ascending,90 of movies people call flops haha For something to really flop IMO it needs to be a super expensive film like 100M and make less than its budget or right around that Jupiter Ascending flopped Edge of Tomorrow didnt
2015-05-30 23:55:58,1,0,1,Jupiter Ascending,Jupiter ascending
2015-05-31 10:06:54,2,0,2,Jupiter Ascending,I thought Nicholson was bad  like ultimate scenerychewing I am shocked we live in a world where a performance like THAT is praised yet a similarly overthetop performance like Eddie Redmayne in Jupiter Ascending is dismissed  and Wahlberg was overrated but Sheen and Baldwin my favorite performance in the film killed it for me
2015-05-31 10:39:46,2,0,2,Jupiter Ascending,I cant wait to see the fourhour cut I also hope theres an extended version of Jupiter Ascending as well
2015-05-31 12:35:20,-1,0,-1,Jupiter Ascending,Its amazing to me how many people found Jupiter Ascending boring I was really gripped by it from the getgo and I loved that bonkers exposition to pieces Its not as if they presented the exposition in dull ways There was exposition via bees and Sean Bean There was exposition via backstabbing siblings clearly simmering with hate for one another There was exposition through a regenerative bath costing the lives of thousands In short it delivered exposition the way I like exposition to be delivered  in all kinds of novel and amusing ways It helped that I found what they were talking about very interesting of course
2015-05-31 16:37:48,7,0,7,Jupiter Ascending,Jupiter Ascending Amazingly bad but damned if I dont feel like a million bucks near the ends when she straps on those flying rollerblades
2015-05-31 16:51:10,-5,0,-5,Jupiter Ascending,I will never understand how people enjoyed Tron 2 Yeah Daft Punks soundtrack was great theyre fucking Daft Punk but everything else the acting the ridiculous story the oftentimes terrible CGI I will never understand how there is demand for another one of these I put it on the same level of qualitycohesiveness as Jupiter Ascending

2015-05-02 18:04:17,1,0,1,Poltergeist,High Tension is one of the few films that got to me I think there must be a pretty easy way to develop a horror profile for individuals Supernatural horror films are very hit or miss with me for example Paranormal Activity type films usually make me roll my eyes slasher films often seem pointless but films like High Tension Carrie Psycho Poltergeist Alien or The Ring I very much enjoy

2015-05-04 18:19:10,1,0,1,Poltergeist,I just saw a trailer for the remake and I was surprised I didnt know they were making one  Im disappointed that they are as the original was fantastic and Im worried they will ruin it If I say poltergeist was wicked scary to a 20 year old theyll probably think Im talking about the remake and call me a wimp

2015-05-12 21:15:25,6,0,6,Poltergeist,Poltergeist by far San Adreas is just going to be another quick high speed action with little to no character build up  Its a movie to see if you just want to see crazy 3d action and the rock
2015-05-12 21:18:53,7,0,7,Poltergeist,and a Poltergeist remake will be just another haunted house doing paranormal activity rehash
2015-05-12 21:34:48,1,0,1,Poltergeist,I dont think San Andreas is going to be bad a lot of CGI but I think poltergeist is going to be a lot better Sam Rockwell is an acting god

2015-05-15 21:04:24,3,0,3,Poltergeist,I think a new Starship Troopers is in the works we just had Total Recall and Robocop Jurassic World is coming out A new Poltergeist Independence Day 2 Alien is getting a next installment Bladerunner is in the works New versions of Halloween Nightmare on Elmstreet The Hills have Eyes etc Scream Limitless Minority Report and Rush Hour are coming out as series
2015-05-15 23:27:32,2,0,2,Poltergeist,There were a handful of 67 year olds at the Thursday Midnight Sneak showing During which they showed the trailers for the new Insidious and Poltergeist films Those kids I really hope were covering their eyes and earmuffing it
2015-05-16 21:56:54,7,0,7,Poltergeist,I saw Mad Max and it was amazing but I dont think word of mouth is gonna save it Next week Tomorrowland and Poltergeist come out and there are so many big movies in theaters that Mad Max wont do that well Plus the week after San Andreas comes out We can hope for 200 million worldwide by then end of its run which is still a very poor performance given how much money was put into the movie
2015-05-17 17:46:17,3,0,3,Poltergeist,Warner Bros is generally pretty conservative as the majors go  Compared to Tomorrowland and Poltergeist Pitch Perfect 2 is the biggest nonR film to open around this period so what might happen next week is that PP2 will see its numbers drop as its a sequel but Mad Max will pick up momentum on the gargantuan word of mouth its got going for it
2015-05-18 02:32:23,2,0,2,Poltergeist,Poltergeist and from dusk til dawn
2015-05-18 03:11:08,1,0,1,Poltergeist,How do you feel about the Poltergeist remake
2015-05-18 19:20:20,1,0,1,Poltergeist,I got terminator genysis jurassic world San Andreas and poltergeist
2015-05-19 00:08:33,-7,0,-7,Poltergeist,Tomorrowland will be the big budget must see movie this coming weekend Poltergeist will be the genre movie to see this weekendthose will take away a lot of potential viewers whod give Mad Max a shot based on word of mouth I tried to hype up as many people as possible to see Mad Max who would normally not see such a movie only a few went and they hated it This movie has no cross over strength
2015-05-19 19:10:55,1,0,1,Poltergeist,My bad Here ya gohttpwwwtimeoutcomlondonfilmpoltergeist2015 I didnt read the review yet but that blurb sums up what my fears were
2015-05-19 22:16:51,-3,0,-3,Poltergeist,I hated the first Poltergeist so Im actually glad its being remade No matter how average this one is Im probably going to like it more than the original I just want a creepy ghost story with some cool special effects I love the modern Insidious shtick going on right now too so its better to go that route than do the same ol bullshit they did the first time
2015-05-20 07:20:13,2,0,2,Poltergeist,I had no idea they made Poltergeist sequels
2015-05-20 13:59:11,13,0,13,Poltergeist,Spielberg didnt direct Poltergeist Tobe Hooper did
2015-05-20 13:59:34,82,0,82,Poltergeist,Steven Spielberg did not direct Poltergeist Gremlins or The Goonies It was Tobe Hooper Joe Dante and Richard Donner respectively Spielberg was involved in the story though
2015-05-20 14:49:46,41,0,41,Poltergeist,Rumour is he directed Poltergeist but wasnt allowed to be credited
2015-05-20 18:15:32,10,0,10,Poltergeist,Tobe Hoopers presence can be felt in Poltergeist but so can Spielbergs I see it as a joint effort without both it wouldnt be as frightening or as accessible
2015-05-20 19:17:59,2,0,2,Poltergeist,Ive heard theres a rare production photo with Spielberg wearing a hat that has ET on the front and Poltergeist on the back so he could swap it around depending on what set he was on because they were filming close together at the same time
2015-05-20 19:27:57,1,0,1,Poltergeist,I can kind of see that Tobe Hoopers only good movies were Poltergeist and Texas Chainsaw Massacre I feel like he just got lucky with TCM and had a lot of help on Poltergeist because all his other movies are very bad
2015-05-20 20:35:00,4,0,4,Poltergeist,It was ET not encounters Cause ET and poltergeist came out in the same year and the studio that distributed ET wouldnt let him direct two movies at the same time
2015-05-20 22:07:40,1,0,1,Poltergeist,There no way in hell Tobe made Poltergeist theres more Spielberg in it that Hooper Just look at Tobes other output over the years
2015-05-20 22:24:24,4,0,4,Poltergeist,TCM 2 is hysterically awesome and similar to the shift from Evil Dead to Evil Dead 2 Poltergeist is amazing and I definitely see some darkness in there that no Spielberg film has Lifeforce is amazing Salems Lot is a pretty great madefortv movie Invaders from Mars is fun His Masters of Horror episode was pretty disturbing I always enjoyed his films the Funhouse and Eaten Alive too good sleazy exploitation flicks Dude definitely has talent
2015-05-21 10:06:47,1,0,1,Poltergeist,It could have been Paranormal 2 judged that way Poltergeist looks like Goodfellas
2015-05-21 13:33:08,1,0,1,Poltergeist,I think that original article in Life Magazine inspired a good few horror movies but the most wellknown would have been Poltergeist
2015-05-21 13:55:05,2,0,2,Poltergeist,I cant vouch either way as I havent seen Poltergeist yet but it just sounds like more of the same derivative nonsense thats plagued the horror genre for a while Its almost totally bereft of originality with only the occasional exception eg It Follows
2015-05-21 14:03:30,2,0,2,Poltergeist,There was quite a few jump scares in the original Poltergeist
2015-05-21 14:58:50,2,0,2,Poltergeist,Yeah this is ridiculous I bet most actresses in their 20s would be declined for the role of Carol Ann in poltergeist too
2015-05-21 15:25:23,5,0,5,Poltergeist,are you saying the original Poltergeist is as good as the Godfather
2015-05-21 15:29:48,16,0,16,Poltergeist,That is a terrible comparison Poltergeist is a very simple story about a haunted house with no particularly memorable characters save for the Theyre here midget lady Not that it is a bad movie but it is exactly the type of film that can be forgiveably remade
2015-05-21 15:52:09,4,0,4,Poltergeist,And according to somehttpwwwpoltergeistpoltergeistiiicomreallyhtml Spielberg basically codirected the film as well
2015-05-21 17:05:33,1,0,1,Poltergeist,I and numerous others of course have some fears about how Poltergeisthttpmoviesfilmsandflixcom20150205johnshorrorcornerpresentsstrongopinionsonthepoltergeist2015remakeasecondopinionnowthatwehaveproducersamraimiandatrailertocomfortus will compare to the originaland all of the movies that have borrowed from it sincelike Dark Skieshttpmoviesfilmsandflixcom20130228johnshorrorcornerdarkskies2013 and Insidioushttpmoviesfilmsandflixcom20130915insidious2adreadernautofpurehorrorawesomeness and Paranormal Activityhttpmoviesfilmsandflixcom20131010johnshorrorcorneranoverviewoftheparanormalactivityfranchise I hope people dont say it ripped off Insidious when Insidious really borrowed from Poltergeist
2015-05-21 19:22:06,6,0,6,Poltergeist,how the hell have you not seen the original Poltergeist
2015-05-21 22:19:51,2,0,2,Poltergeist,No I think it was Poltergeist 3 I remember Carol Anne would look at the mirror and her reflection would move differently I used to live in a big old house with a lot of mirrors in the living room and at night I would literally run through that room if I wanted to go to the kitchen
2015-05-21 23:17:22,4,0,4,Poltergeist,Youve been given many good examples  Here are a few others  Arlington Road The Brady Bunch Movie The Swimmer Edward Scissorhands Neighbors the 81 film Heathers Far From Heaven The Graduate Little Children Safe A Nightmare on Elm Street Ordinary People Detention Pleasantville Poltergeist A Serious Man and Welcome to the Dollhouse
2015-05-21 23:27:12,2,0,2,Poltergeist,Poltergeist 3 is the one with the mirrors where Carol Anne lives with some relatives in a highrise
2015-05-21 23:40:04,2,0,2,Poltergeist,Poltergeist would be rated R for this scene httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvQsMCOmn11zs
2015-05-22 00:22:45,1,0,1,Poltergeist,Ok hold up I have not seen the original poltergeist However I know certain scenes and knew this was 100 a remake Thats the part about his comment that blows my mind How the hell has he not even heard of poltergeist until recently
2015-05-22 02:21:08,-4,0,-4,Poltergeist,Poltergeist is a true specimen of its time Its more interesting to me as a demonstration of the movie making methods of the time than it is as a horror movie Its dated but in a very photogenic way like the breakfast club
2015-05-22 02:29:48,4,0,4,Poltergeist,Im talking about the new poltergeist Ive seen a few scenes of the older one and it didnt really phase me Unless you were jokingly being sarcastic

2015-05-22 13:42:30,3,0,3,Poltergeist,Thats Carrie Anns Theme from Jerry Goldsmiths The Poltergeist That score is widely considered to be one of Goldsmiths best scores Marc Strietenfield on the other hand didnt do too good a job following up I recommend skipping it
2015-05-22 19:49:23,2,0,2,Poltergeist,Or where they talk incessantly  about their imaginary friend thats actually some demonghostpoltergeist

2015-05-23 02:34:51,1,0,1,Poltergeist,Not surprised at all I like the actors involved but its hard to top the nearly perfect original The original Poltergeist just has so much charm The characters and pacing are excellent The stoner parents that Im sure will be absent from the remake are a nice relatable touch too
2015-05-23 03:48:06,6,0,6,Poltergeist,Blair witch project is the only thing relatable in this generation if you saw that movie on opening night in 1999 you would understand the comparison Now we get the CGI infested Poltergeist remake You kidding me
2015-05-23 12:50:37,1,0,1,Poltergeist,A version of Nightmare on Elm street A dark side force sensitive is killed by people on a rim planet and comes back as a kind of force ghost but can only manifest in dreams Would work with Poltergeist too I guess
2015-05-24 17:57:47,1,0,1,Poltergeist,I personally liked the Poltergeist remake probably an 810
2015-05-24 18:36:32,7,0,7,Poltergeist,The Original Mad Max which i thought was good but not great Maybe its because it is from 1979 but at times it seemed cheesey and the writing seemed shaky at best However i did enjoy it I also saw the new Poltergeist with some of my friends and that was movie was  very very very very bad

2015-05-24 23:06:48,5,0,5,Poltergeist,Totally dont see the link Poltergeist made me afraid of ghosts and old cemeteries
2015-05-25 01:34:26,0,0,0,Poltergeist,Are you confusing Poltergeist with the Ring I was more afraid of giant trees clowns and gypsy ladies after seeing Poltergeist than I was of technology
2015-05-25 04:45:27,1,0,1,Poltergeist,Interesting I just saw Poltergeist and liked it pretty well Granted its forgettable standard jumpscare stuff but Sam Rockwell was awesome as the dad all the characters were actually very solid and had great dynamics the visual style was strong the music great and it was inventive and fresh enough to justify its own existence the drone scene was especially memorable and exciting It wont be remembered like the original but its a fun movie and I dont mind its existence
2015-05-25 05:22:30,1,0,1,Poltergeist,Yeah Poltergeist didnt teach us to fear technology the fuck are you on a out

2015-05-25 16:28:22,1,0,1,Poltergeist,I went and saw the movie and the theater had blown out subs and I still thought the movie was incredible at the very beginning u know they are going to the Valhalla then towards the end u find out that they were there all along They were basically on a suicide mission Mad max had a shitty personally because he was being used as a blood bag completely understandable Very thought out movie you know how long George miller has been working on it and all the shit he went through making it The new poltergeist by the way was just awful I cant believe I wasted 12 bucks to see that heap
2015-05-25 21:19:11,1,0,1,Poltergeist,Talk about a bummer Between him and the announcement of the actor portraying Pennywise I was really excited for this movie Fucking Poltergeist
2015-05-25 21:31:04,1,0,1,Poltergeist,Poltergeist is supposed to suck
2015-05-25 22:18:51,22,0,22,Poltergeist,Worst thing is I read in another article that they are scared because of the poor box office of the Poltergeist remake because that marketing campaign also included a clown lol
2015-05-26 00:10:50,1,0,1,Poltergeist,Poltergeist for me
2015-05-26 03:21:44,0,0,0,Poltergeist,I saw it and it was pretty good 810 But that is weird usually theres at least two discussion threads and I regarded Poltergeist as being a big movie
2015-05-26 05:01:41,0,0,0,Poltergeist,Truth to this As someone who was traumatized by IT as a child the Poltergeist clown has nothing on IT It jolted me for a second and then I was like HA dumb Poltergeist clown You dont scare me
2015-05-26 08:52:20,1,0,1,Poltergeist,To show you how bad the remakesequel culture has gotten In this weeks top 10 there is a Mad Max movie and a Poltergeist movie
2015-05-26 13:32:39,1,0,1,Poltergeist,Poltergeist There is a remake in theaters now but the old one is creepy as well From the 70s or 80s I believe
2015-05-26 15:10:23,5,0,5,Poltergeist,Poltergeist fuckin sucked
2015-05-26 18:29:05,3,0,3,Poltergeist,Conspiracy theory is that it was actually Directed by James Cameron Kinda like how Steven Spielberg Directed Poltergeist
2015-05-26 18:51:35,0,0,0,Poltergeist,Not really She was married to him at the time Is it fucking retarded that a lot of people say Steven Spielberg directed Poltergeist or that Kurt Russell directed Tombstone
2015-05-26 21:37:53,-3,0,-3,Poltergeist,Im not a CGI hater My opinion on CGI is that it should be a last resort in meaning that if practical effects are not possible or get the job done then by all means use CGI as an option However this has limits I look at the original Jurrasic park as a good example Lots of practical effects along with CGI when it was called for I find even today this movie holds up and as far as CGI goes still looks good I find today that CGI is too quickly the go to in terms of effects Look at the new mad Max that movie could have been done all CGI however majority of it was practical effects To me with practical effects I can feel the action more and be right into the scenesetting CGI now takes me out of the film and feels so cartoonist and fake Take the new jurrasic world or I dunnothe new poltergeist remake Horror movies do not need CGI and I feel that less is more when it cones to horror I feel like this principal is lost now in modern films a lot So thats why I say CGI as a last resortnot no CGI just a last resort and in moderation Much like Nolan Im also not a fan of 3d films however I find animation is a good home for it
2015-05-26 23:21:45,2,0,2,Poltergeist,Nothing really came out apart from a Poltergeist remake the nobody wanted and a Tomorrowland that flopped  It was a bad weekend considering previous and future releases this year
2015-05-27 04:07:41,1,0,1,Poltergeist,The Poltergeist remake theyll never be in a better position to enjoy it
2015-05-28 02:40:36,1,0,1,Poltergeist,You know I think 2015 is a good year for movies but the only movie I saw this year that I didnt like was poltergeist But all and all it might just be taste not every movie is for everyone just know what you are walking into Like if u want to see a comedy that is what you expect or a action film its what you expect I liked interstellar because it is a scifi I expected a ton of talking and a ton of science shit not really looking forward to action but it was a bonus at parts I liked tusk because it was a comedydrama I didnt expect much but it delivered my expectations Poltergeist is a horror I basicly got what what was delivered in the 80s didnt deliver my expectations and basicly had nothing to offer for me although the film quality was spectacular I kinda went off on a tangent but modern movies are focusing more on ground breaking technology and experimenting with technology If you want a old school style movie with none of the fake cgi bullshit watch the new mad max So in conclusion I dont blame you Most modern movies suck flaky pubes
2015-05-28 16:53:45,2,0,2,Poltergeist,Exactly Hollywood has this propensity to take great horror projects and water them down so that the finished product is some bland middle ground between a tame family horror movie and something that should actually be scary It sucks what they did for the Poltergeist remake And Im tired of the trend set by the ConjuringInsidious movies IT is one of Kings best works and a lot of people will pay to see an adaptation thats damn scary So give us that I dont want to see them tweak a lot of Fukunagas vision in order to play it safe
2015-05-28 19:50:22,2,0,2,Poltergeist,Poltergeist remake
2015-05-29 02:41:19,1,0,1,Poltergeist,I too was disappointed I enjoy some remakes but this one had my eyes rolling thinking it wasnt worthy of production It left a bitter taste in my mouth even though I was excited when I first heard about the remake a year or so ago The Psycho remake I loved and Rob Zombies Halloween remake was great and scary But the Poltergeist remake made me feel a little sad that it existed
2015-05-30 07:46:09,2,0,2,Poltergeist,Which poltergeist are we talking about here If its the new one youre better off skipping it and spending your money on something like Mad Max
2015-05-30 15:18:53,11,0,11,Poltergeist,Except Blade Runner bombed also  ET was probably the biggest factor followed up by Wrath of Kahn and Poltergeist
2015-05-30 16:50:55,4,0,4,Poltergeist,Original Poltergeist Although thats probably not quite what youre looking for
2015-05-30 16:55:12,10,0,10,Poltergeist,Ill throw a vote to 1982 with movies such as The Thing ET Blade Runner Rocky III Gandhi Poltergeist Fast Times at Ridgemont High The Wrath of Khan and Tron
2015-05-31 13:29:21,3,0,3,Poltergeist,Im pretty easy going with my moviestv I can forgive a lot of things so long as Im entertained That said there is no way I could relate to the family Clearly he made a lot of money before and when he was laid off they didnt adjust their lifestyle to have maxed out so many cards What really got me was the way they talked about the house like it was a shit hole Its a really nice house if it didnt have a poltergeist he didnt have a job and he wasnt willing to let her work Somehow they were able to buy a really nice house with no jobs and maxed out cards that have presumably led to poor credit but they still hated it I could understand the bitchy teen but the adults Anytime they were talking about anything not poltergeist related I just wanted them to STFU and leave
2015-05-30 21:30:46,6,0,6,Brotherly Love,Well I mean its an understandable complaint As someone from Philadelphia which has an almost 50 percent black population Id be annoyed at a film that bothered to set itself there but made it seem as though only happy white folk inhabit the City of Brotherly love
2015-05-05 22:35:21,3,0,3,Pitch Perfect 2,A valid point But more often than not you see them trickle in early Pitch Perfect 2httpwwwrottentomatoescommpitch_perfect_2 and Good Killhttpwwwrottentomatoescommgood_kill already have reviews in and they open the same day as Mad Max I mean Avengers 2 had reviews available ten days aheadhttpwwwrottentomatoescommavengers_age_of_ultronreviewspage13ampsort I mean hell even Spyhttpwwwrottentomatoescommspy_2015 which comes out in a month has reviews available
2015-05-07 23:36:51,9,0,9,Pitch Perfect 2,Its opening against Pitch Perfect 2 in America so odds are both will split the opening weekend market I see it doing well but losing steam seeing as the summer season is just now kicking off
2015-05-08 12:42:08,1,0,1,Pitch Perfect 2,I think to break that 7080 million mark you need to attract women as well This movie is pretty masculine in its appeal rated R and its opening against Pitch Perfect 2
2015-05-08 14:46:53,2,0,2,Pitch Perfect 2,11250 as of right now For reference Pitch Perfect 2 is at 10552 right now and that will most likely break the first ones 113m box office
2015-05-10 18:27:57,10,0,10,Pitch Perfect 2,Hot Pursuit Little Boy and Pitch Perfect 2 Ill be so glad when I stop seeing those awful trailers in the theater Thank god some of them are already out
2015-05-11 02:30:11,1,0,1,Pitch Perfect 2,Pitch Perfect 2 Movie of a bunch of outcasts who think the they are doing the coolest thing on earth singing a capella I watched their Lose Yourself performance on MTV award then I went back to watch Pitch Perfect 1 I was like WTFs this shit I LITERALLY HATE THE GUTS OUTTA THIS FRANCHISE
2015-05-11 16:29:50,26,0,26,Pitch Perfect 2,gt Or Pitch Perfect 2
2015-05-11 17:27:13,1,0,1,Pitch Perfect 2,Last time I checked it tracking to go head to head with Pitch Perfect 2 and Age of Ultron All three will be in the 40 million range PP2 will likely come out on top but neither new release will fail
2015-05-11 18:38:02,1,0,1,Pitch Perfect 2,But but but pitch perfect 2
2015-05-11 18:57:42,1,0,1,Pitch Perfect 2,Pitch Perfect 2 opens this weekend
2015-05-11 19:09:29,2,0,2,Pitch Perfect 2,this is gonna make a crowd pleasing double header with pitch perfect 2 yall
2015-05-11 19:42:19,3,0,3,Pitch Perfect 2,Im a 20 year old white male and love actions films and all but Pitch Perfect 2 and Fury Road of course is my most anticipated movie of the year ahead of Jurassic Park Star Wars and Avengers which Ive seen already Its rare you get a fun smart youngadult comedy ala Mean Girls Easy A etc and damn sure Im excited for it I might see it back to back with Mad Max should be a fun day
2015-05-11 22:31:23,6,0,6,Pitch Perfect 2,If Pitch Perfect 2 wins the boxoffice over Fury Road get ready for reddit to shit on it
2015-05-12 01:54:33,0,0,0,Pitch Perfect 2,I feel like this movie will get crushed at the box office by Pitch Perfect 2 Which is sad because we all know this looks like it will be a WAY better movie
2015-05-12 02:15:22,0,0,0,Pitch Perfect 2,But Pitch Perfect 2
2015-05-12 07:53:13,3,0,3,Pitch Perfect 2,I saw Pitch Perfect 2 the other night nobody clapped Not sure if its because its not the done thing or it was a shit movie Probably a bit of both
2015-05-12 08:34:03,1,0,1,Pitch Perfect 2,Pitch Perfect 2 English Full Movie Watch OnlinePitch Perfect 2 English Full Movie Watch OnlinePitch Perfect 2 English Full Movie Watch OnlinePitch Perfect 2 English Full Movie Watch OnlinePitch Perfect 2 English Full Movie Watch OnlinePitch Perfect 2 English Full Movie Watch OnlinePitch Perfect 2 English Full Movie Watch OnlinePitch Perfect 2 English Full Movie Watch OnlinePitch Perfect 2 English Full Movie Watch OnlinePitch Perfect 2 English Full Movie
2015-05-12 14:35:56,3,0,3,Pitch Perfect 2,Almost certainly not opening weekend But if its as good as the critics think its possible word of mouth keeps it going and it outearns Pitch Perfect 2 in the long run
2015-05-12 15:41:45,0,0,0,Pitch Perfect 2,I agree although they are both tracking close to 30 mil opening Pitch Perfect 2 cost around 30mil to be made while Mad Max has cost 150mil
2015-05-12 17:18:32,1,0,1,Pitch Perfect 2,I really the movie does well this weekend and doesnt get buried from Pitch Perfect 2
2015-05-12 19:01:54,13,0,13,Pitch Perfect 2,I cant wait for Pitch Perfect 2
2015-05-13 00:55:45,1,0,1,Pitch Perfect 2,SO current tracking has Fury Road competing for 2nd place at the box office 1 Pitch Perfect 2 coming in around 50mil then Fury Road and Avengers coming in around 40mil
2015-05-14 15:41:17,49,0,49,Pitch Perfect 2,And here I am going to see Pitch Perfect 2 with my girlfriend tonight
2015-05-14 17:32:30,16,0,16,Pitch Perfect 2,Seeing Mad Max tomorrow Pitch Perfect 2 on Saturday High five
2015-05-14 18:40:21,5,0,5,Pitch Perfect 2,My sister bought my ticket for Pitch Perfect 2 tonight so who am I to complain about a free movie that Ill still probably enjoy Shes way more into it than I am but I like the music aspect of it
2015-05-15 03:21:36,6,0,6,Pitch Perfect 2,Pitch Perfect 2 is the cinematic equivalent of pop music Mad Max Fury Road is METAL as FUCK
2015-05-15 06:54:14,-2,0,-2,Pitch Perfect 2,Not that impressed just going by the trailers Think Ill go see Pitch Perfect 2 instead
2015-05-15 12:23:11,2,0,2,Pitch Perfect 2,Im kind of having a hard time seeing how Pitch Perfect 2 is projected to beat it
2015-05-15 14:45:00,0,0,0,Pitch Perfect 2,I think the best comparison is 22 Jump Street Pitch Perfect 2 also takes the most obvious route for a sequel However I was just looking for another two hours with these characters and I got that The songs are enjoyable the characters loveable and the comedy on point theres nothing groundbreaking but also nothing offence
2015-05-15 14:49:38,26,0,26,Pitch Perfect 2,I agree with everything you said Ive been telling everyone I know to go out and see it this weekend A group of my friends went to see Pitch Perfect 2 last night and my brother one friend and I saw Fury Road I was legitimately mad at my other friends who saw Pitch Perfect Mad Max needs the financial support over Pitch Perfect
2015-05-15 16:09:00,-1,0,-1,Pitch Perfect 2,That saddens me I really wanted to I might sneak in after Pitch Perfect 2 is over just to see
2015-05-16 00:49:57,3,0,3,Pitch Perfect 2,Im sorry but this movie was no Pitch Perfect 2
2015-05-16 01:25:22,2,0,2,Pitch Perfect 2,Thought it would be more crowded but theater isnt even half full Makes me sad I think more people are watching pitch perfect 2
2015-05-16 13:30:43,2,0,2,Pitch Perfect 2,Whats wrong with Pitch Perfect 2
2015-05-16 13:39:14,7,0,7,Pitch Perfect 2,Im sure Hollywood is very surprised that the movie that more people could go and see with broader appeal is tracked to make more money Its not like Pitch Perfect 2 is a tentpole release for Universal though  its counterprogramming for the female demographic If it grosses more than Mad Max it really wont affect the flow of more or less RRated action films because Mad Max is on track to successfully capture its own audience
2015-05-16 14:50:55,4,0,4,Pitch Perfect 2,I cant believe that in downtown Toronto the lineup was for Pitch Perfect 2 no line for MM Boys make sure to take your girlfiends to Mad Max next time Its only fair
2015-05-16 15:04:38,5,0,5,Pitch Perfect 2,It will be such a shame if it turns out Pitch Perfect 2 beats Mad Max opening weekend
2015-05-16 15:58:31,15,0,15,Pitch Perfect 2,Yeah but its likely Pitch Perfect 2 is going to be box office champ to Mad Max
2015-05-16 16:30:20,69,0,69,Pitch Perfect 2,Id like to say Im surprised but Im really not Between the hangover of the Avengers and the sequel of a more recent hit film series in Pitch Perfect 2 I was always skeptical of releasing this movie  in May I think they overestimated Mad Maxs place in pop culture
2015-05-16 16:42:25,-12,0,-12,Pitch Perfect 2,Well box office gross says nothing without the budget of the movies It also says nothing without mentioned the producers who bankrolled the whole thing The vision behind Fury Road is a lot different than the vision behind Pitch Perfect 2 and I think theyre both accomplishing what they intend to accomplish
2015-05-16 16:56:09,7,0,7,Pitch Perfect 2,Fury Road cost 150 million dollars putting it up there with the budgets of PG13 superhero films which routinely cross the 500 million mark General rule of thumb is that a film starts turning a profit after making double the production budget And from my understanding 31 is when studios start taking interest in franchisesequel potential Pitch Perfect 2 cost 29 million
2015-05-16 17:25:33,254,0,254,Pitch Perfect 2,Wouldnt be shocking at all to see Pitch Perfect 2 beat Mad Max  Has a bigger and more family friendly audience  If they thought they were going to compete with one another then they wouldnt have released it the same week
2015-05-16 17:37:53,-20,0,-20,Pitch Perfect 2,Not saying this is a big reason but how many teenagers do you think bought tickets for Pitch Perfect 2 to sneak into Mad Max
2015-05-16 17:55:14,2,0,2,Pitch Perfect 2,O M G Pitch Perfect 2
2015-05-16 18:24:09,94,0,94,Pitch Perfect 2,Considering its an Rrated movie thats competing with Pitch Perfect 2 and Age of Ultron Id say thats a big win I was expecting 24M at least and Ive never been more glad to be wrong Now hopefully word of mouth and the rave reviews spreads on the next couple weeks so more people would go see it
2015-05-16 19:10:53,57,0,57,Pitch Perfect 2,I wasnt a huge fan of Pitch Perfect 2 The music was fantastic but the jokes were almost family guy level And thats coming from someone that loved the first one
2015-05-16 20:04:35,3,0,3,Pitch Perfect 2,I dont even think Pitch Perfect is a good movie but when I went to watch Mad Max and I felt like the majority of people in line both ahead and behind me wanted to watch Pitch Perfect 2
2015-05-16 20:26:20,5,0,5,Pitch Perfect 2,Well the most obvious is that Mad Max isnt being marketed towards that age group and Pitch Perfect 2 is so its much more likely that theyd go see the latter
2015-05-16 21:10:33,-12,0,-12,Pitch Perfect 2,How do shit movies like Pitch perfect 2 make so much money I cant even stand to look at that whale Rebel Wilson for 5 minutes
2015-05-16 21:53:39,5,0,5,Pitch Perfect 2,Did anybody who saw Fury Road notice that in both movies theres a surprise matriarchal group at the end that provides support to the young women Its not an original idea I know but middle aged women are so underused in movies that they stood out in these two rare cases The stunts werent as good in Pitch Perfect 2 though
2015-05-16 22:00:43,71,0,71,Pitch Perfect 2,Just saw Pitch Perfect 2 Its cute and crowd pleasing with little to offend casual moviegoers and lots to make fans of the first one happy Wouldnt be surprised if it gets legs from that
2015-05-16 23:09:00,-1,0,-1,Pitch Perfect 2,gt I felt like the majority of people in line both ahead and behind me wanted to watch Pitch Perfect 2
2015-05-16 23:23:00,3,0,3,Pitch Perfect 2,I have more expectations for Pitch perfect 2 than i had for Avengers 2 And i really love the MCU
2015-05-16 23:37:41,1,0,1,Pitch Perfect 2,Im worried for this film Went to see it today I bought tickets on Fandango for the BigD theater the largest screen at my local 20plex When I got there they informed me I would get some of my money back because they had moved Mad Max to a smaller theater since it wasnt selling well and put PITCH PERFECT 2 in the BigD theater instead Who the hell cares if they see Pitch Perfect in the mega screen theater So dumb After I mumbled something about bait and switch grumble grumble I saw the movie anyway It was a amazing but what a disappointment
2015-05-17 01:31:58,1,0,1,Pitch Perfect 2,Not surprising Nothing against pitch perfect 2 as I actually was pretty entertained by the first film But it caters to a wider audience by being silly and playful Mad max is dark and action packed It has a very acquired taste kind of vibe I really liked that it managed to stay true to the other films while using modern effects
2015-05-17 02:18:14,1,0,1,Pitch Perfect 2,Just finished watching this grand spectacle for the third time damn shame Pitch Perfect 2 beat it For now I only caught about two mistakes that stuck out to me
2015-05-17 03:14:17,1,0,1,Pitch Perfect 2,Im not surprised that Pitch perfect 2 surpassed Mad Max Fury Road for opening weekend Why wouldnt you want to see a movie about pitches singing
2015-05-17 03:56:16,1,0,1,Pitch Perfect 2,I havent seen the second one but the first one wasnt a reality movie  It was just a normal fictional musical  From the wikipedia page Pitch Perfect 2 looks like it is the same thing  Just a completely fictional story about an all female A Capella group
2015-05-17 04:05:35,-1,0,-1,Pitch Perfect 2,I see my comment on top happy to see it there I went to see this movie at 10 am A standing O with 10 people in the theater wish I was there with everyone else in a packed theater why did I see it at 10 am Pitch Perfect 2 with the lady last night Mad Max washed that acastuff right off 3034
2015-05-17 05:35:08,2,0,2,Pitch Perfect 2,I really hope this doesnt flop We need more ballsy films like this that arent afraid to break the rules Right now it looks like fucking pitch perfect 2 is gonna beat it at the American box office Smh
2015-05-17 06:25:10,1,0,1,Pitch Perfect 2,They actually moved Mad Max out of the bigger screen auditorium at my theater to put in Pitch Perfect 2 Really pissed me off
2015-05-17 10:03:33,1,0,1,Pitch Perfect 2,So is Pitch Perfect 2 a low budget Horror movie or a Big Budget Tentpole Blockbuster expected to destroy everything in its path
2015-05-17 12:53:37,-10,0,-10,Pitch Perfect 2,Why are we talking about mad max when pitch perfect 2 crushed the box office
2015-05-17 15:09:45,1,0,1,Pitch Perfect 2,Go to theater See notice that movie times are sold out Like 5 showingsof pitch perfect 2
2015-05-17 15:44:52,14,0,14,Pitch Perfect 2,Seriously Pitch Perfect 2 has Reggie Watts in it Dude transcends gender genre and MPAA rating
2015-05-17 15:45:37,0,0,0,Pitch Perfect 2,Man a 703 million opening weekend for Pitch Perfect 2
2015-05-17 15:47:33,22,0,22,Pitch Perfect 2,Ill be the one to say it pitch perfect 2 Im a grown heterosexual manly man type but I enjoy going on outings with myself friends As a group they decided on pp2 so I go because the first one had some humor to it I laughed my ass off and overall it was really fun film to watch horrible puns and all
2015-05-17 15:50:47,9,0,9,Pitch Perfect 2,According to polls the audience for Pitch Perfect 2 was 80 female and Mad Max was 70 male this weekend Im a guy who liked the first Pitch Perfect but have no desire to see the second in theaters
2015-05-17 16:30:38,12,0,12,Pitch Perfect 2,Both films out grossed the entire runs of their predecessors in their debuts Much more impressive for Pitch Perfect 2 due to inflation but Mad Max still grossed more than half of Thunderdomes gross adjusted for inflation
2015-05-17 16:41:02,1,0,1,Pitch Perfect 2,Its Pitch Perfect 2 for me as well It was much funnier than the first one and the funniest movie Ive seen in a while
2015-05-17 17:10:48,2,0,2,Pitch Perfect 2,Fury Road was an awesome movie but I think it cost way too much to make It made 13 of its budget while Pitch Perfect 2 earned double its budget already Im doubting well see another sequel anytime soon even though they have scripts for 2 more movies
2015-05-17 17:28:14,2,0,2,Pitch Perfect 2,Well Max was in line with expectations on the higher end actually but its reviews and the controversy about it being very female heavy will help its word of mouth Pitch Perfect 2 was expected to gross in the mid 40s a week ago 50ish after Thursday night showings Mid 60s after Friday and early Saturday It ended up with 70 million That kind of increase just doesnt happen with front loaded films
2015-05-17 17:29:00,0,0,0,Pitch Perfect 2,I know reddit hates hyping stuff but DAMMIT Fury Road deserves it  I mean Pitch Perfect 2 is beating MAD MOTHER FUGGIN MAX
2015-05-17 17:39:34,1,0,1,Pitch Perfect 2,That would be awful it was too awesome and a masterpiece compared to whatever Pitch Perfect 2 must be like
2015-05-17 17:46:17,3,0,3,Pitch Perfect 2,Warner Bros is generally pretty conservative as the majors go  Compared to Tomorrowland and Poltergeist Pitch Perfect 2 is the biggest nonR film to open around this period so what might happen next week is that PP2 will see its numbers drop as its a sequel but Mad Max will pick up momentum on the gargantuan word of mouth its got going for it
2015-05-17 18:56:03,1,0,1,Pitch Perfect 2,Most experts thought Pitch Perfect would win the the weekend anyway  The last Mad Max film came out 30 years ago so there is a whole generation that does not have the attachment to it that older people might  Plus I am sure Avengers took some of the box office that Mad Max might have gotten while Pitch Perfect 2 was targeted at and entirely different audience
2015-05-17 19:44:59,0,0,0,Pitch Perfect 2,ok i know this sounds really sexist but as a guy who doesnt like being aroundhearing my best guy friends farts or my girlfriends fart the movie was disgusting to me especially the wedding dress part i like pitch perfect 2 but same complaint there too many fart jokes for movie thats a female centered cast
2015-05-17 20:07:46,0,0,0,Pitch Perfect 2,Pitch Perfect 2  Saw with my fiancee I secretly loved the first one was good silly fun with a predictable story arc I enjoyed myself thoroughly even if I was the only male in the cinema   810
2015-05-17 20:25:23,3,0,3,Pitch Perfect 2,The two movies dont compete for the same audience Teenage girls are most definitely more interested in Pitch Perfect 2 Mad max  on the other hand  is relevant to the age group who were young when they watched the 1979 and 80s mad max movies  Even that group is torn between mad max and Avengers 2or had just finished watching Avengers and feel like going to movie theater again may be too soon
2015-05-17 20:43:28,0,0,0,Pitch Perfect 2,WTF did nobody see pitch perfect 2 Holy shit that movie was hilarious carried the energy from the first movie added some great new characters and was a whole bunch of fun I really cant believe no one mentioned it yet
2015-05-17 20:44:46,10,0,10,Pitch Perfect 2,Tell everyone you know to see it Thats what Ive been doing and so far I think Ive convince a good amountstill trying to convince my family but they just want to see Pitch Perfect 2
2015-05-17 20:58:39,1,0,1,Pitch Perfect 2,Pitch Perfect 2 while worth it to watch AK alone is easily worse than the second Also that scene where she jumps into the crowds at the end of the trailer its not even in the movie Overall meh Will see Mad Max next week after watching the original sometime this week
2015-05-18 01:48:12,4,0,4,Pitch Perfect 2,I have noticed this too I still havent seen the movie because I want to see it in 2d and my theater 24 screens is only showing it in 2d about 3 times a day Ive never seen this theater show a new movie so few times I went and saw Pitch Perfect 2 with ease but finding the time for Mad Max hasnt worked out No wonder the numbers for this weekend are lopsided
2015-05-18 05:29:53,1,0,1,Pitch Perfect 2,How did Pitch Perfect 2 outsell Mad Max  I lost more faith in the world to it  Did my part and saw Fury Road  It was everything I hoped it would be and more  Ill be recommending it to everyone at work tomorrow and hopefully it makes enough for them to start on the next one soon
2015-05-18 06:17:00,3,0,3,Pitch Perfect 2,Simple answer they knew it wouldnt beat Pitch Perfect 2 so it gets the less desirable showings Long answer its been so long since the last movie that they were probably not sure how the turnout would be for it and kept the showings low to minimize risk I wouldnt be surprised to see it get more showings next weekend
2015-05-18 15:14:50,4,0,4,Pitch Perfect 2,Why are these two being compared like this  Did anyone expect them to compete with eachother  I bet the women in line to see Pitch Perfect were thinking I want to see a movie but I dont know if I want the one where the crazy looking people murder eachother with crazy cars in the desert or the one with the singing competition  Mad Max will do ok but an R rated action movie will not make the kind of money everyone knew Pitch Perfect 2 would make at least not on opening weekend
2015-05-18 17:53:31,11,0,11,Pitch Perfect 2,I honestly have never heard of Pitch Perfect until this Pitch Perfect 2 movie was released
2015-05-18 19:47:36,22,0,22,Pitch Perfect 2,I rip tickets at my theater and I ripped waaaay more Ultron and Mad Max tickets this weekend than Pitch Perfect 2 tickets
2015-05-18 20:30:36,4,0,4,Pitch Perfect 2,I also gave my friends shit for seeing Pitch Perfect 2 instead of Fury Road
2015-05-19 00:59:32,6,0,6,Pitch Perfect 2,at the cinema I work at it was just a wave of teenage girls everywhere My place is 6 floors and the girls were just everywhere Pitch perfect 2 was mental where I am
2015-05-19 02:02:41,-2,0,-2,Pitch Perfect 2,Box office for the weekend was good but not ridiculously so 110M worldwide against a 150M budget It lost out to Pitch Perfect 2 which you may interpret however you like
2015-05-19 02:50:50,-3,0,-3,Pitch Perfect 2,What about it  It was worse than Pitch Perfect 2  Yes we know
2015-05-19 05:08:58,5,0,5,Pitch Perfect 2,This is why Im glad I did a double feature Mad Max first and the Pitch Perfect 2 Oddly enough Mad Max was a more femenist movie than the film made up of girls bonding over a capella
2015-05-19 05:20:22,3,0,3,Pitch Perfect 2,I went twice Neither was packed but both had a good amount of people I think Max will do well overall and end up being more memorable than Pitch Perfect 2 IMO
2015-05-19 05:37:55,1,0,1,Pitch Perfect 2,haha pitch perfect 2 how did this happen
2015-05-19 10:24:17,8,0,8,Pitch Perfect 2,Pitch perfect 2
2015-05-19 11:51:56,2,0,2,Pitch Perfect 2,Ummm what are you talking about I dont know where you live but in my area adult dramas like Noble The Water Diviner Far from the Madding Crowd Woman in Gold and The Age of Adaline are all currently in wide release Then theres two stupid comedies hot pursuit Paul Blart one kids movie which are usually better than adult dramas anyway although Home which is currently in theaters probably is not whatever Pitch Perfect 2 is a postapocalyptic 80s action movie Mad Max and a superhero movie Avengers I know you were being hyperbolic about multiplexes being half superhero genre flicks but still we only have three or four a year is more emblematic of a modern trend than some sort of cultural genocide Treatment of females in movies overuse of digital instead of film stock and expensive 3D are more viral and more concerning trends in film
2015-05-19 11:52:48,1,0,1,Pitch Perfect 2,Pitch Perfect 2 Movie song
2015-05-19 13:20:15,0,0,0,Pitch Perfect 2,Pitch Perfect 2 Moviehttpmegasharexcompitchperfect22015watchonlinefreemegashare is far better than the part 1 Awesome Movie Really Enjoy The Movie
2015-05-19 13:58:32,115,0,115,Pitch Perfect 2,I saw Mad Max and Pitch Perfect 2 on sunday
2015-05-19 17:06:24,3,0,3,Pitch Perfect 2,But compared to Pitch Perfect 2 its not doing nearly as well
2015-05-19 17:31:21,1,0,1,Pitch Perfect 2,Mmmm Nah  So terminator is just an action movie  Mad max is future speculation with nuclear war mutants steampunk cyborgs and robot arms  Pitch perfect 2 is probably pretty good and is not SciFi  I dont agree with Simon pegg that all these sci fi movies are warping our sense of reality or anything  I was just pointing out that Age of Adeline aside from basically being a pretty crappy movie has SciFi exposition voice overs to explain her immortality

2015-05-20 01:02:26,1,0,1,Pitch Perfect 2,You had a preview for a movie that also just opened Pitch Perfect 2
2015-05-20 02:44:13,1,0,1,Pitch Perfect 2,I went to Pitch Perfect 2 a few days after Mad Max Fury Road just to see what the hype was about Painfully average movie
2015-05-20 13:06:16,1,0,1,Pitch Perfect 2,Because it is a bait and switch The womens rights groups would also flip shit if eg Pitch Perfect 2 had a male lead who would be shouting orders at that troupe and the thunder was diverted to him and to the other genius guys in the movie All without expressing said change in trailers and marketing it as a chickmovie
2015-05-20 17:20:36,-1,0,-1,Pitch Perfect 2,I wouldnt count on that Pitch Perfect 2 69 mil did better than MMFR 45 mil
2015-05-20 17:55:22,6,0,6,Pitch Perfect 2,How does that matter Pitch Perfect 2s gross is irrelevant to Mad Max Totally different demos By the way Mad Max made more on Monday than Pitch Perfect 2 and also made more money worldwide on the weekend

2015-05-21 15:46:58,2,0,2,Pitch Perfect 2,Katie Segal has basically been a TV and voice actor where the standards are more relaxed Yeah shes in Pitch Perfect 2 but aside from that basically all her movies have been straighttovideo fluff
2015-05-22 03:12:21,3,0,3,Pitch Perfect 2,I didnt see it Pitch Perfect 2 is out for Christ sakes
2015-05-22 05:29:22,0,0,0,Pitch Perfect 2,Barely making back your money the first week and not making back your money opening weekend isnt considered a huge success in Hollywood especially if your film is beat out by Pitch Perfect 2
2015-05-22 11:03:30,3,0,3,Pitch Perfect 2,Sucks to live in a day and age when pitch perfect 2 doubles it at the box office  I sometimes think society doesnt deserve movies like this
2015-05-22 15:42:34,4,0,4,Pitch Perfect 2,Yeah I wish the movie made more but when its all said and done I think it will outperform expectations at the box office Pitch Perfect 2 has a much wider audience demographic so it makes sense
2015-05-23 05:56:19,-1,0,-1,Pitch Perfect 2,Who knows Its not like this is rare though Pitch Perfect 2 made almost twice the money mad max did on their opening weekend The modal film goer is a fickle tasteless boob I guess

2015-05-24 05:41:57,1,0,1,Pitch Perfect 2,Theater by my has 5 Tuesdays Usually I can make it a week before I see another movie but I couldnt Tuesday I saw Pitch Perfect 2 today I saw Mad Max Fury Road Theaters dont make as much off tickets as they do concessions Not nearly as much Your ticket mostly goes to Mad Max I think
2015-05-24 16:08:37,437,0,437,Pitch Perfect 2,Yes it has happened before Its honestly not a big deal at all Being 1 just means they can add it to TV spots but even if Tomorrowland beats out Pitch Perfect 2 then PP will just run TV spots saying 1 comedy in the country
2015-05-24 16:26:35,45,0,45,Pitch Perfect 2,Its funny you mention Pitch Perfect 2
2015-05-24 18:06:46,3,0,3,Pitch Perfect 2,This may be an unpopular opinion but I think that it coming out on the same weekend as Pitch Perfect 2 hurt it a bit However I do think itll do well internationally and with Blu Ray and such I hope it does well because while it may not be an original IP Ive read nothing but good things about it
2015-05-24 22:35:34,-1,0,-1,Pitch Perfect 2,It is if the studio decides it is The fact that Mad Max lost to Pitch Perfect 2 and Tomorrowland means that we wont get our sequels because itll be too big of a risk

2015-05-25 09:18:36,1,0,1,Pitch Perfect 2,Uh because you are comparing movies that were in theaters for several weeks compared to Fury Road which was out for only 2 weeks so far Pitch Perfect 2 is rated PG13 so it has a much larger potential audience compared to Fury Road its also a sequel to a recently hit movie whereas the Mad Max franchise has been dead for awhile
2015-05-25 10:38:03,1,0,1,Pitch Perfect 2,Jurassic Park and Pitch Perfect 2theres a clear better movie here it seems One is my favorite movie of all time and the other I never want to see again
2015-05-25 18:02:46,5,0,5,Pitch Perfect 2,I saw this prior to watching Pitch Perfect 2 in theaters yesterday and it made the 11 dollars worth it Just to see this featurette on the big screen was good enough for me even if the movie I saw after it was subpar IMO
2015-05-25 21:31:42,3,0,3,Pitch Perfect 2,The worst movie Ive seen so far in 2015 has to be Pitch Perfect 2 That being said its not a bad movie just really mediocre All the other movies Ive seen have been good or great IMO
2015-05-26 01:32:54,0,0,0,Pitch Perfect 2,I saw Pitch Perfect 2 and I really really liked that but its sitting at 67 so Im not sure that counts Im planning on watching Tomorrowland here soon
2015-05-26 02:49:19,1,0,1,Pitch Perfect 2,Its more of the latter The movies Ive seen this year in theaters Age of Ultron Fury Road Spongebob 2 Kingsman and It Follows Think thats it besides the obvious Pitch Perfect 2
2015-05-26 08:53:57,1,0,1,Pitch Perfect 2,Thats strange Maybe she was expecting Pitch Perfect 2
2015-05-26 11:19:39,29,0,29,Pitch Perfect 2,Or that nothing great opened this weekend Tomorrowland was okay Pitch Perfect 2 and Mad Max were out the weekend before Avengers has been out for 3 weeks now If Tomorrowland was better Im sure it wouldve been better ticket wise
2015-05-26 15:32:02,1,0,1,Pitch Perfect 2,Normally Id agree but it has a lot of competition Upon release it will still have to contend with Fury Road Tomorrowland Pitch Perfect 2 and Age of Ultron
2015-05-27 03:17:02,6,0,6,Pitch Perfect 2,Furious 7 blew projections away Same with Pitch Perfect 2 just to name a few
2015-05-27 11:11:54,-3,0,-3,Pitch Perfect 2,huhthats weird Your description of tomorrowland is exactly how I would describe Pitch Perfect 2
2015-05-27 13:48:07,2,0,2,Pitch Perfect 2,Its rated R so less people can see it and up against movies that are seemingly appealing to a broader base Pitch Perfect 2 and Tomorrowland There are major demographic groups that are skipping out on Mad Max who would be in for either of the other two options Tomorrowland while you may have not heard about it it sucks by the way was strongly promoted and also appeals to a broad base as a family movie directed by who is usually one of the great family filmmakers Brad Bird Its also had a massive promotional campaign from Disney Mad Max is still doing pretty well though if I had it my way itd be making a hundred million every week

2015-05-01 08:52:58,1,0,1,Wild,Im seeing a lot of the opposite opinion here but I thought there was more tension from the villain side than in the first Avengers Hiddleston as Loki was cool and great on screen but it never felt dangerous The Chitauri were just wildly overmatched for anyone on the team it looked more like an aggressive workout than a desperate bid to save the world New York I really enjoy the movie but its more about how fun it is to watch the characters than dramatic doubt obviously theyre going to punch flying aliens for a while then find a way to stop the portal confront Loki and roll credits

2015-05-02 05:50:53,1,0,1,Wild,Although the movie itself is mediocre there is a great conversation scene in The Ruins just before the characters take off for the titular ruins The cuts and framing of the characters change wildly and make the entire scene far more interesting because of it

2015-05-02 08:40:12,1,0,1,Wild,I thought the plot was wildly mediocre Like an AI couldnt bypass nuclear codes Or that people could breathe above 12000 feet Or that that small chunk or earth could be accelerated fast enough to wipe out the human race Ultron is probably the dumbest AI thats ever existed in any movie

2015-05-02 16:13:18,1,0,1,Wild,cool movie beautifully shot the part where the kid sings to her and leaves was my favorite part of the movie Laura Derns performance was also another major highlight with that said even though its a cool movie i still found it lack luster maybe because 2014 had so many amazing films and i compared it to the likes of Tracks which i like way more the protagonist in Wild was quite selfabsorbed imo which didnt really make me care for her at all even though i usually deeply relate to themes of loss and grief there was also a sense of cliche on the part of most characters apart from Laura Dern the helpless brother the husband who cant do anything to help the abusive redneck of a dad the nice farmer who unintentionally subjugates women the playful teens etc it was basically a tragic main character who undergoes the woes of misogyny grief relationships with immature guy friends and family members and embarks on what was supposed to be a cathartic journey that helps her realize that she was always wild a lot of the flash back scenes that were graphic but not so graphic were a bit cheap in the sense that it made the director seem like she wanted to use shock value to put the fear or despair that the protagonist was feeling into the audience which it didnt for me i find the words facial expressions and body language of characters especially in this kind of film to be much more compelling and honest than something thats already intended to make me feel bad in a sentimental way if the movie put more emphasis on her journey as a walk through her strife in life no not just grief for the dead it would make the moments where she finds clarity that much more powerful and make Wild a much more natural and compelling movie but thats just my crazy talk and its still a cool movie

2015-05-03 00:36:04,-2,0,-2,Wild,You know the dialogue in the original films was highly criticized as well Am I saying every line of dialogue in the prequels is immune to criticism Certainly not but there is a fair bit of stylization and intent in the writing and given the inspiration behind Star Wars it makes a lot of sense Lucas has admitted to such Denying it is sensible because if you dont like something you find it difficult to give it even a grain of credibility because that small little grain of credibility can be wildly misinterpreted as granting legitimacy and I know how much the internet does not want to legitimize the prequels I assure you can still hate the prequels and acknowledge that the dialogue is intentionally awfulthough once again Im not sure why people get hung up on the dialogue in the first place given the genre

2015-05-04 15:07:28,2,0,2,Wild,Jodorowsky and Lynch represent an entirely different kind of bizarre  That said I agree that Roar is quite the wild ride  Simultaneously hilarious and horrifying its funny to see the actors get interrupted by lions but its depressing to think how many of them actually were injured on set  I think my favorite pet had to be with the woman in the barrel being thrown around by the elephant which was absolutely bonkers  Great great film hope to pick it up on BluRay in the future when its released

2015-05-04 19:27:36,7,0,7,Wild,The problem with that movie was its audience is really REALLY specific To fully enjoy the movie you need to have nearencyclopedic knowledge of The Beatless music and history while also being okay with covers that vary wildly in both quality and adherence to the originals Oh and the main plot is a romance with random heavyhanded abstract imagery and social commentary sprinkled throughout

2015-05-06 20:48:58,1,0,1,Wild,Standalone Punisher is cool but doesnt really work He needs to interact with other characters in the universe His kill em all attitude works better when hes used as a foil with SpiderMan or Daredevil or someone else with a similar shaky moral code but who has a wild enough spin on them like Wolverine or Black Widow Tom Hardy is too good for Punisher A Netflix series would be perfect with him popping up in Daredevil first then going after campy goofy villains  Obviously Tom Hardy wouldnt play him

2015-05-08 07:05:44,5,0,5,Wild,101 Things You Didnt Know About Wild Hogs is one of the greatest books on film ever written Weinstien manages to channel Peter Biskind and John Simon into one deftly written book that reads like a sexy calamity about the filming of Wild Hogs I was impressed by the idea that Weinstien had once considered Kevin James to play an apparition of Dennis Hopper in a hallucinogenic dream sequence during a camping trip in which Wild Hog member Robin Williams would take some peyote and then see Hopper dressed in his Easy Rider costuming in a fever dream James was reported to say during the filming that he broke down in tears because Walt Beckers directions were so impressionistic and moving for that particular scene that he would turn away from doing anything that dark again  Weinstein said that Jamess performance was on par with Max Von Sydows in The Seventh Seal for how transcendentally moving Jamess acting during the scene had been

2015-05-08 15:20:29,1,0,1,Wild,I have to recommend The Naked Prey by Cornel Wilde  It was this film that my dad always used to watch  And only having one tv in the house at the time we kids could either play outside or sit with my old man while he drank a beer and watched The Naked Prey on VHS

2015-05-09 06:57:53,49,0,49,Wild,Last night was crazy too Wild Hogs references and theories about Pinocchio relating to child trafficking
2015-05-09 06:58:04,1,0,1,Wild,It wasnt remotely out of character He was a shitty marine from the getgo No one said oh hey these are the bestest bravest marines in the universe It was just one random ass group going on what most people thought was a wild goose chase And certainly they had more than likely never faced anything as terrifying as a hive of xenomorphs its one of the main reasons the company wanted them in first goddamn place That scene is a prefect example of a well executed character flaw
2015-05-09 07:09:04,14,0,14,Wild,I almost looked into the Wild Hogs thing but I was like its too late Let the sub get weird
2015-05-09 07:30:50,4,0,4,Wild,Yeah I checked tv and couldnt find anything Wild Hog related Nothing in MCJ Was pretty weird so figured it was time for bed
2015-05-09 08:42:58,2,0,2,Wild,That didnt bother me at all Gave it the feel of a video essay than a traditional doc Im glad there wasnt any interview footage wouldve made this more about the specific people who think these things rather than people who think like this in general Documentary is still filmmaking but it doesnt mean it needs to look n feel like every other documentary Seems fitting that wed only see images of The Shining or isolation the kind of environment these wild theories take root in
2015-05-09 10:41:41,1,0,1,Wild,I liked it Vincent was arrogant and calculating and therefore quite predictable  he even goes for the two in the heart one in the head through the subway door you can see the bullet holes but Max is wild and unpredictable firing blindly and wins
2015-05-09 15:19:06,1,0,1,Wild,I have a problem with the fact that it makes wild assumptions and tries to gloss that over with a veneer of logic The same sort of criticisms applied to certain examples apply to the classification of other examples
2015-05-09 15:25:12,2,0,2,Wild,Lets just say 9year old me who really enjoyed Wild Wild West would have LOVED this movie

2015-05-09 18:34:11,4,0,4,Wild,Wait did people not like the new TRON Its a two hour techno music acid trip with Olivia Wilde in leather Therefore its the best movie ever made
2015-05-09 18:35:19,5,0,5,Wild,All of them honestly The first one sets up the second You see it go from a downtrodden society to a punk rock wasteland in the second Can not wait for the new one It is going to be fucking wild Miller back doing what he does best

2015-05-09 22:40:18,7,0,7,Wild,LEGO movie has some fun scenes in the Wild West though I wouldnt call it desert life exactly
2015-05-09 22:52:28,-1,0,-1,Wild,Your reply here really elevates humanity You are really using these films to connect with your fellow man calling him a twat and disagreeing with the basic conversation of the discussion thread about how someone complained that the dreams in the film werent creative and wild enough

2015-05-10 01:15:02,1,0,1,Wild,Thats what I thought at first but theres no such thing as a clearcut case of Innoccent by reason pf insanity Maybe it wouldnt even go that far in the court Or maybe the public would have a wildly different reaction than we suspect
2015-05-10 01:33:40,-1,0,-1,Wild,Its pretty muddled but David was a lot different between the two drafts of the film where is purely evil in the original version but by filming has changed into a calculating but in many ways innocent or bewildered Pinnochio character The film has 3 beginnings one with David and it shows that Lindeloff has no clue how to write cohesively He sets things up with little connection later or muddles his metaphors or just lets character disappear for large parts of the film David is clear evidence of this Not so much a red herring but walking talking Macguffin that got too much screen time at the start or too little at the end

2015-05-11 06:13:58,3,0,3,Wild,Ryan Reynolds I personally think hes a terrible actor and though I never thought he was even remotely funny I cant help but to think of him as Van Wilder whenever I see him Learning that he was cast to play Deadpool immediately ruined the movie for me which hurts because Deadpool is one of my favorite comic book characters
2015-05-11 07:31:15,1,0,1,Wild,For me its Tron Legacy The first time I watched it I thought it was rubbish I read the reviews amp so many people were saying the same I watched it the second time amp thought its actually not bad Ive watched it a few times since amp Ive come to really enjoy it Its visually beautiful epic soundtrack Michael Sheen is awesome amp Olivia Wilde is hot Im looking forward to Tron 3 Tron Uprising was awesome too If you never got the the chance to see it in HD you missed out Shame it got cancelled

2015-05-11 18:11:50,6,0,6,Wild,Its censorship Why do you think HBO shows are so wildly popular They have more freedom to not censor their content When every blockbuster is PG13 it gets old after awhile Nice change of pace to have some hard violence language nudity and adult situations once in a while Not everything needs to be family friendly
2015-05-11 18:22:20,-4,0,-4,Wild,HBO shows are not wildly popular Game of Thrones is the most successful show they have and it gets 8 million viewers in a night Thats not even in the top 50 shows on TV
2015-05-11 18:28:05,1,0,1,Wild,Too wild Its just confusing I had no idea what the hell the concept is
2015-05-11 18:31:36,7,0,7,Wild,You are forgetting about Sorpranos True Blood True Detective Boardwalk Empire Entourage Sex and the City etc Game of Thrones is just one success story out of many for HBO Lets not trivialize what HBO has done for the history of television by making The Sopranos They started a trend by having uncensored shows To say that HBO shows are not wildly popular and base it all on Game of Thrones is very ignorant
2015-05-11 18:36:40,3,0,3,Wild,Never said they were the most popular shows on television I said wildly popular If I said they were the number one show on TV you could prove me wrong I just said they are very popular

2015-05-11 20:06:53,11,0,11,Wild,The author of the article used that word not the storytellers  The point is that they have to carefully work these conversations into popular pieces because people that hold your opinion will tune that conversation out immediately otherwise  You are just proving them right  I feel like you found a bit you wanted to plaster all over this thread but wildly missed the point of the interview
2015-05-11 22:13:51,2,0,2,Wild,I hear what youre saying but I think both are good in their own ways because they are trying for different things  In that scene luke is overcome with rage hes just swinging wildly  He also has no professional training so again just sort of swinging  Vader on the other hand isnt trying to kill or even best luke  He is just a punching bag taking the hits  He is trying to anger luke to turn him to the darkside so no retaliation  Hes also old and hasnt had a real saber fight in almost 20 years ignoring the EU of course  Which leads to the slower pacing and the emotional feel
2015-05-11 22:33:46,3,0,3,Wild,Its been a long time since Ive seen it but I remember a scene in Silver Streak where Gene Wilder uses shoe polish to give himself blackface then talks jive so he can sneak past the police to get on a train

2015-05-12 14:08:51,22,0,22,Wild,one has to appreciate that not every 80s action film was of the same type but that psychological drama played a far larger role in action films at that time  i was a teen in the 1980s and i can barely stomach the typical action film of the 2010s because they are almost all entirely vapid and without any internal conflict or even discernible characters to support narrative tension  thats a trend that had begun in the 80s see 1986s Aliens which i loved but which is 10 of the compelling narrative of Alien and made action movies a joke for a while see 1997s Batman and Robin but that has run wild with notable exceptions eg The Dark Knight trilogy

2015-05-14 03:09:46,0,0,0,Wild,Do you think theres any hope for a Wild Hogs expanded universe in these turbulent modern times That movie was born in the fertile crescent of a loving and simple era When kids could be kids Hogs could be Hogs and a movie with the heart of a lion and the soul of a swan could move us all to tears I worry for the future of this fragile flower in the swarm of horrid consumerism that is todays hollywood

2015-05-14 03:54:29,2,0,2,Wild,In that same piece I noticed that everyone being interviewed declined to mention Martin Lawrences name I did some digging and found an old newspaper clipping at my local library about three hooded individuals dumping the body of a man into the river downtown By cross referencing the height of the men in the photo to iMDB records I determined the men to be John Travolta Ray Liotta and Walt Becker himself It seems they got in a heated disagreement with Lawrence over the proper way to cook the Hogs after the production of Wild Hogs was finished Lawrence wanted medium rare but the rest were all hankering for well done They killed him and ate the hogs after vowing never to speak of what happened I obtained this information at great risk to a bus boy from Belize so be careful who you tell

2015-05-14 04:06:35,2,0,2,Wild,Its interesting that you mention that because I met Martin Lawrence during the premier of his new film at Cannes Welcome Home Roscoe Jenkins and I was shocked to discover that he in fact did not look like Martin Lawrence Its a perk of my job that I get to travel to see movies so when I discovered that only one year later after I had already steeped myself in the semiotics of Walt Beckers instant classic Wild Hogs that he was very different from what he looked like in Wild Hogs Different skin tones his goatee was now a full grown beard when he sweat in the presence of the everyone under the hot French Rivera sun Mr Lawrence would run double time up the steps of the theater and make a bee line for the restroom It was when I cornered him to get him to autograph my copy of Harvey Weinsteins seminal book 101 Things You Didnt Know About the Filming of Wild Hogs he went completely white quite literally Security had ushered me out before I could inquire further but it looked as if Lawrence since those tragically reported events is now being assumed by the man who started it all Mr Walt Becker I shant not tell more because I fear for my lively hood here in Hollywood

2015-05-15 17:08:59,-2,0,-2,Wild,They have already gone the route of make up a new dinosaur by gene splicing sort of like dog breeders do ie a Labradoodle And from raptors being so vicious the had to lower in a cow into an electrical caged in pen to feed them to Pratt and possibly Omar Sy being able to have a relationship with beasts We have seen Pratt can stand in enclosure with them and not get mauled to death So Im not pissing on the plot of the movie before I see it Im just not ruling out what may seem like all the over the top wild possibilities
2015-05-15 18:21:49,21,0,21,Wild,My take was it was another clan of survivors that Max promised to save but didnt That is why his current mission was so important Its best to look at Max like a lone gun from the wildwest He shows up when hes needed helps the helpless and then leaves expecting no praise Just like Eastwoods Man without a name
2015-05-15 18:27:05,3,0,3,Wild,yes this is it Think of it as a western type movie The Australia shown in Mad Max is like the old American Wild West  Lawmen and Outlaws duking it out over some semblance of society

2015-05-15 23:43:28,1,0,1,Wild,Its tough to pinpoint one but if you asked me on any given day Id either say Alfred Hitchcock or Billy Wilder They were both amazing I think Wilder did a better job of diversifying himself throughout different genres but then again Hitchcock was almost a unique genre on his own
2015-05-16 02:31:01,1,0,1,Wild,Been waiting for a sequel for either this or Wild Wild West so I cannot wait Hopefully well see them going to China bring it full circle
2015-05-16 03:29:54,1,0,1,Wild,Haters gonna hate I thought it was well done The whole thing was crafted to be a wild ride and Whedon used a lot of clever tricks to tie disparate characters backstories into elegant transitions through a continuous emotional thread For instance one characters distraught dream would be set directly against another characters waking fears similar in mood but unique in context and yet I believe they still fit together I feel like Whedon was really focused on the flow of this piece and the cohesion he sought was that of what any good ensemble film is going for a balance between individuals and a team I left feeling inspired and although I wouldnt say it was a deep film I would recommend it to my friends
2015-05-16 04:20:03,1,0,1,Wild,Agreed I feel like if those people that want action Take into consideration the year it was filmed and the budget theyd understand how wild and cool it was for its time

2015-05-16 08:20:35,2,0,2,Wild,SPOILERS Im just in awe that this movie was made Really cool when you let a deeply creative and talented person run wild with a film I just needed to comment about a series of moments that had me cheering laughing and then in shock in the span of 3 or 4 seconds I had no sense of time in that movie When The Splendid wife saves them from the baddies on the side of the truck and Max gives the little thumbs up I was laughing hysterically then when the door breaks it was just heart wrenching Im gonna see it again either tomorrow or next weekend so I can process a bit more
2015-05-16 08:46:07,7,0,7,Wild,gt In November 2011 filming was moved from Broken Hill to Namibia after unexpected heavy rains turned the desert there into a lush landscape of wildflowers inappropriate for the look of the movie
2015-05-16 12:57:08,2,0,2,Wild,I highly recommend Wild Bill and hes pretty good in it
2015-05-16 13:48:51,12,0,12,Wild,I sat in my car for about 510 minutes after the movie ended because I had to come down from all of the adrenaline The whole ride home I kept thinking that I need to find a desert area and drive wildly through it
2015-05-16 15:28:59,1,0,1,Wild,it wouldnt be necessary to bring in cumberbatchs audience considering GotG was such a wild success all they have to do is make a good movie and people will watch it

2015-05-17 16:15:21,1,0,1,Wild,World Gone Wild is a lot of fun Its a postapocalyptic spoof that kind of works on its own but is hilarious if youve seen any of the Mad Max 2 clones particularly those from Italy that flooded video store shelves in the years following 1981 Stars Bruce Dern Michael Par Streets of Fire and Adam Ant as the bad guy

2015-05-18 22:10:17,6,0,6,Wild,Yup plus that can add to the mystique Another example of a movie that did this was Alien You got a lot of glimpses at cool stuff that let your imagination run wild Like The Space Jockey it created questions and added a mystique to the movie Then Prometheus came out and expanded on those mysteries and it sucked

2015-05-19 03:42:24,60,0,60,Wild,A good zooaquarium can do so many great things for animals and the people who enjoy them  Most professionals who work at these places have dedicated their lives to learning and understanding more and more about these animals in the hopes of helping them thrive in both captivity and the wild There are bad zoosaquariums and some have made mistakes in the past and will probably make some in the future but the overall goal of any halfway decent zooaquarium is preservation of nature and knowledge of those in it
2015-05-19 04:18:42,4,0,4,Wild,Its definitely a feminist action movie if people saying fuck THAT to an intensely patriarchal society that marginalizes just about everybody is feminist Max is just as much a victim of that system as the harem Furiosa is female and so that certainly plays into her motivation for rescuing the wives over say the sickly warboys but it really does illustrate a male dominated society gone wild Max is just as invested and committed to taking down Immorta Joe as anyone could be

2015-05-22 17:02:44,1,0,1,Wild,I know its a theory but does anyone notice how much Max resembles to the wild kid from Road Warrior Think about it In Road Warrior the kid meets Max and he thinks he is badass and fearless all that stuff Then maybe the time passes and as the Wild Kid travels more he learns how to talk instead of grunts and noises Look at Max in this movie at the beginning he grunts a lot his sentences are short his hair and beard is a long he is somewhat afraid of everything and doesnt trust almost anything and there is one thing that I have to admit it shocked me a lot his aim He has a wonderful aim except with the sniper When Mel was Max he didnt have a good aim it was hit or miss But the new Max is somewhat better
2015-05-22 17:05:20,1,0,1,Wild,This is EXACTLY right  Whereas Vaders story is exposed Fetts remains shrouded in mystery  For a franchise of movies that showed exactly how wildly a movie can spark imaginations this makes Boba Fett like Crack for the imagination

2015-05-24 01:16:40,1,0,1,Wild,Word of mouth is powerful Ill be honest I really was looking forward to it I saw it opening weekend and left with a real feeling of disappointment It was beautiful yes It was a wild ride to say the least But It lacked story and character development Max himself was not at all necessary for the story His character could have been removed and it would have been just as good Maybe better as it would have lacked the expectations  Furiosa was amazing and truly was the best thing about the whole film Just My 2 pesos

2015-05-24 20:31:34,1,0,1,Wild,Wahlbergs very good at playing a very specific type of character the angry slightly bewildered blue collar person who is usually but not always also a cop The Departed The Other Guys Ted which is a terrible movie but hes great in it and Boogie Nights are all goodtoexcellent performances from him But when he tries to go outside that wheelhouse he doesnt have the range to pull it off
2015-05-24 20:39:05,3,0,3,Wild,I think a small role that hes often forgotten for is Into the Wild Wasnt over the top or really typical Vince Vaughn He just took the role played it and the movie continued Nothing spectacular but he is more than a one trick pony when trying I definitely am scaling back my excitement for TD season 2 though Hoping it can do for Collin Farrell what season 1 did for Woody Harrelson and my view on him

2015-05-25 01:46:47,15,0,15,Wild,I am a big fan of the originals  Whether or not you like the films you cant deny the impact they had on films literature and even video games in the coming years  Fallout Borderlands etc  Heck George Miller pretty much invented the postapocalyptic genre  I was unbelievably hyped for it  I read all the reviews and watched all the reactions but part of me was still nervous  When the film started with the ignition sound of an engine I was filled with anticipation  Once the movie title flashed on the screen and Fury Road was emblazoned upon it with a rad 80s font I knew I was in for a wild ride  Every little area of the film has been praised to no end  It is honestly and truly a perfect 1010 for me and I give those out very rarely  However one thing that I think really hasnt been stressed enough on is the nature of the soundtrack  Everyone says its awesome but it is so so SO much more  It IS the scene  The soundtrack permeates the films frames and melds with it  No other movie soundtrack I have heard has felt so perfectly in tune with the film  I know the circle jerk is out in an obnoxiously strong force for the film but seriously it 100 deserves it  Major props to Junkie XL for delivering what I believe to be a someday iconic soundtrack

2015-05-26 07:35:52,25,0,25,Wild,Not a blockbuster but today I just watched a really beautiful film called Snow Walker and beforehand I had read a bunch of reviews claiming it to be a romance film It wasnt at all it was basically a movie where a white guy and an Inuit girl are stranded in the wilderness together and all that develops between them is respect and friendship She calls him brother at one point There isnt anything approaching romance between them but yet its called a romance film This was incredibly refreshing to see their developing friendship was far more easy and natural to watch than a forced love story would have been but surprising to see how many reviews just slapped on the romance tag needlessly
2015-05-26 07:51:28,1,0,1,Wild,Fuck that shaky cam Whoever thought it would be a great idea to bury the action under wild camera shaking was a fucking moron This idea works for horror movies like Blair Witch Project because it lends some credibility to the character holding the camera Its interesting but should not be in action movies at all I want to see the fight scenes the choreography the brutality and not get sick by the camera and miss half of whats even going on

2015-05-26 17:47:35,1,0,1,Wild,I actually agree Nolan is a literalist so partly it is intentional but his films lack the really tight visual and grounded directing that would call for and he lacks the wild imaginative imagery that truly great directors evoke
2015-05-26 19:05:27,9,0,9,Wild,Just in terms of the horror genre its giving a lot more people the tools with which to tell their story  The result of course is a lot of terrible horror films  But Id argue that the genre is as strong as its ever been  The difference is that some of the best horror films are no longer getting a theatrical release  Theyre going right to Netflix and other streaming services  And the crazy thing is that the creators dont seem upset by this  Ive talked to numerous directors who never even in their wildest dreams envisioned a theatrical release  It was more important to them to get the film out on as many platforms as possible  To me this is nuts as when I started in the biz a theatrical release was the end all be all  But who am I to argue with the filmmakers themselves

2015-05-27 04:29:40,1,0,1,Wild,You make some good points Im just kind of exploring the idea that there are certain constraints on film that influence the kind of SF movies we get resulting in a consistent variance between mainstream acceptance and SF fan response I mean first of all SF tends to be expensive so we rarely see pure SF in major motion pictures And the primary thing about technobabble is that it takes up time which is a very limited resource in film So yes in a lot of cases we get films that happen to be set in an SF context because thats the current bigbudget formula The SF setting is a justification for having a lot of expensive special effects that allow a large studio to get a big return on their investment Gravity for instance is really just a survival story that in the past has been set in the wilderness the mountains out at sea etc
2015-05-27 06:27:54,14,0,14,Wild,Why did they even bother I mean the characters and the plot seem so removed from the original that whats even the point Utah was originally a farm boy jock who was seduced by the wild life Bodhi and his crew opened Utahs eyes to surfing and chasing the ultimate ride In this movie the actor farts out the line I believe that like me they are extreme athletes So Utah is already an extreme thrill junkie So now theyll just have to go TRIPLE SUPER EXTREME to satisfy Utahs bored with normal bland regular extreme stunts

2015-05-28 22:43:56,12,0,12,Wild,Yet another aspect of the movie I loved  It is very cool that there was never any major confrontation between the title character and the bad guy  Hell Immortan Joe had no idea who Mad Max was and likely couldnt care less  Like George Miller said himself in an interview Max is just a wild animal trying to survive  The ultimate loner

2015-05-29 15:23:51,52,0,52,Wild,Billy Wilder Everyone forgets him because of two things
2015-05-29 15:35:56,10,0,10,Wild,Billy Wilder made many great films across multiple genres
2015-05-29 16:10:01,2,0,2,Wild,Ill go Billy Wilder He did noir films war films comedies dramas a courtroom drama He had some serious range
2015-05-29 16:28:41,2,0,2,Wild,I thought Tom Hardy absolutely owned the character  Hes just pretty much a wild dog who does what he has to do for most of the film
2015-05-29 16:40:14,3,0,3,Wild,Thor 2 has a lot of fun and visually beautiful scenes People wildly underrate itwell IMO anyways
2015-05-29 16:58:28,137,0,137,Wild,Original in this case means it isnt based on an existing franchise not that its wildly innovative and doing things other films have not
2015-05-29 17:35:46,1,0,1,Wild,If this movie which was inspired by a Disney ride was original because it was not a sequel then Pirates of the Caribbean was also original in the same way Because Pirates has been wildly profitable for them I dont see why they wouldnt continue attempting to replicate its success with more original movies for certain definitions of originality
2015-05-29 17:58:13,0,0,0,Wild,Yep totally agree Its a beautiful movie but the story was about as predictable and straightforward as any mainstream blockbuster Its a good movie but I honestly dont understand the wild praise
2015-05-29 17:59:30,1,0,1,Wild,Theres no reason it couldnt be wildly creative original and innovative just because the original movies were more popular than Mad Max Nothing in the trailer for Jurassic World leads me to believe its going to buck action film tropes let alone the cliches and tropes from its own franchise But thats selfinflicted not an unavoidable fate because of the predecessors
2015-05-29 18:23:41,3,0,3,Wild,Unfortunately his artistic fuck ups always seem to end up being wildly successful financially Lost was the biggest show on TV at the time and Into Darkness and Prometheus were both top films at the box office
2015-05-29 18:51:46,1,0,1,Wild,That is correct for The Apartment Wilder is actually to date the ONLY one to do so
2015-05-29 18:55:07,1,0,1,Wild,Indeed Wilders noir films were always particularly noteworthy
2015-05-29 19:14:58,1,0,1,Wild,Destiny is a wildly popular game despite its weak storyline  You dont need the DLC to enjoy the game and Im not sure why youre complaining about missing extensions to a storyline you just said you dont like
2015-05-29 19:43:23,1,0,1,Wild,Watch Wild Tales it is an uproarious Tarantinoesque romp featuring six unconnected stories of revenge It was nominated for this years Best Foreign Language Film Oscar

2015-05-29 22:47:28,4,0,4,Wild,Imagine this Piercing blue eyes Thats wild I cant take my eyes off of th Those are big
2015-05-30 00:22:40,1,0,1,Wild,Thats one writers opinion hardly fact To think hes more influential than Homer or Dante is pretty ridiculous To think that someone within the last 100 or so years has had more of an influence on literature which has been around for thousands of years is ridiculous He didnt have any influence on Hugo Dickens Twain Wilde and thats only within the last 150 or so years Explain his influence on the thousands of years of literature that existed before he was born You can make the argument he has done so for contemporary literature but ever No Thats like saying Kanye is more influential than Bach except imagine Bach existed thousands of years beforehand
2015-05-30 01:38:15,3,0,3,Wild,this makes me sad Legacy was a wildly underrated movie The cast was solid the visuals were stunning and Daft Punk flat out killed the soundtrack

2015-05-30 04:23:57,9,0,9,Wild,Into the Wild is one of my favorite movies intelligent take on society and nature with good acting and scenery

2015-05-30 06:51:20,-5,0,-5,Wild,Why are people disappointed by this Tron 2 was a really really bad film It had a few cool looking moments and a great soundtrack but overall the best thing about it was Olivia Wilde in that skintight suit thats the truth and you all know it
2015-05-30 06:58:56,2,0,2,Wild,Selma or A Most Violent Year first Theyre both great and Wild was extremely mediocre and rather boring IMO

2015-05-30 12:29:02,1,0,1,Wild,Into the Wild To me its the only one with some meat of those movies Both Prometheus and Interstellar are visually spectacular but have incredibly mediocre writing
2015-05-30 14:12:07,1,0,1,Wild,I would be happy if they expanded best original song into best original songlyrical and best original song instrumental Pieces like The Ecstasy of Gold or The Wild Horde could get some additional recognition

2015-05-30 16:32:46,10,0,10,Wild,Im not entitled But they announce a 3rd one is possibly in the works And then pull it The first movie was fantastic I was too young at the time so im not sure why it didnt succeed more The 2nd movie was just as great albeit should of been made a lot sooner It also made 400 million Another one would be awesome We get to see what happens with olivia wildes character which is a program in the real world
2015-05-30 19:13:23,2,0,2,Wild,Olivia Wilde is hot
2015-05-30 20:07:06,6,0,6,Wild,This is taking the view point that everyone deserves wild success Rather everyone deserves the opportunity to achieve wild success which this anecdote proves to be true Knowledge is out there whether someone makes the sacrifices and puts forth the effort for a chance is a separate story True some people simply do not have the ability but it doesnt mean they didnt get a chance

2015-05-31 06:01:09,5,0,5,Wild,Inception is pretty much a spy type heist movie and I think the tone and direction they took with all the dream worlds really reinforces that spy style Silent handguns and suits with the whole one last job story would really feel out of place if he instead went all out with the wildness of the dream world I really do love this film and I totally can understand how a lot of people felt disappointed on how they handled the dream world but I really liked the style and not to mention a great score

2015-05-31 19:56:54,1,0,1,Wild,I think there will be From the rumors Ive heard about the original TRex returning and wild velociraptors it sounds like theres going to be a theme of nature being uncontrollable
2015-05-31 22:50:07,4,0,4,Wild,Its wild how much things change over time as older generations die away This was that old California white establishment real Reagan RepublicanBrown Democrat power structure still pissed off about the 60s still baffled that poor people wouldnt stay in their place They said Fuck on a record we had better get the country club moms together and start banning this music There are vestiges of it these days but like any past era unless you were there breathing it in every day its almost impossible to describe and not sound cliche
2015-05-03 04:47:25,6,0,6,Get Hard,Boxing is also very individual whereas many of the sports you mentioned are team sports hence why you get more social or community films with those sports  eg Invictus Boxing leads itself to something very cinematic Also lets not ignore the fact that boxing fights are some of the biggest sporting events in the world The top boxers are some of the most top paid in the world Boxing is also one of the most unfairly paid sports where the top gets tonnes but the losers get hardly anything contrasted to say goldtennis where if youre the 20th best in the world youre still making a handsome amount This all leads itself to ragstoriches stories notions of the American Dream its interesting that nearly all of the films mentioned are American etc

2015-05-12 15:16:28,1,0,1,Get Hard,Big budget hard R action movies however are rare at least compared to how they used to be Big budget movies like Terminator 2 were hard R back in the 90s Now when they make a movie like that it is sanitized to all hell no blood no foul language and made PG13 so it can hit all the key demos and so we end up with shit like the Total Recall remake and Terminator Genisys
2015-05-14 11:48:54,1,0,1,Get Hard,Like the new movie Get Hard
2015-05-19 11:12:42,15,0,15,Get Hard,Completely agree I was thinking when I watched Get Hard the other week that Im just so sick of casually racist films but I never expected it to come from Pitch Perfect Each character had just one trait  the lesbian girl was just saying things showing shes into girls The Guatamalan girl only talked about suffering and stuff Its really tired
2015-05-23 06:43:30,8,0,8,Get Hard,I hate to say that this movie really made me less interested in Kurt I was angry at him while watching this Sure he had trouble with his parents divorce but he was basically a spoiled brat as a child and put himself on a never ending spiral of selfishness once things started to get hard for him Hes well documented and that is interesting but hes no musical genius The things he wrote in his notebooks were the same crap every teenager thinks about while trying to fall asleep at night Maybe that was the appeal of his music to all of us but when you see where it comes from it just makes you wish someone else made it a song Hes just the kid that thought he was better than everyone else and no one wanted to be around Once the hormones wore off he was already into hard drugs which kept his selfish mind in a rebelious teenager state He just never seemed to grow up or he was too selfish and cynical Once people started to give him overwhelming praise he couldnt handle it because he knew deep down that he wasnt anything special His success was mostly just good timing between the changing of guard from Hair Metal to Guns n Roses and the rise of the NW music scene built by Alice in Chains Soundgarden and other much more talented bands The band was a sloppy mess until Grohl started drumming and the only good live performance theyve had are the Unplugged session and probably a handful of concerts Kurt felt like trying for He was a selfish addict and I feel bad for the people that had to be around him This documentary ruined any mystique that surrounded the band or Kurt

2015-05-11 12:58:23,27,0,27,Kingsman: The Secret Service,Nothing NOTHING tops the mass murder scene in Kingsman The Secret Service which was accompanied by none other than the guitar solo of Free Bird  Lynyrd Skynyrd If you havent seen that movie yet I think its coming to Digital HD soon If you like blood gore and comedy give it a watch This scene is so amazing Lots of murder lots of guitar solo Spoilers Theres also a scene near the end where heads pop off to the wonderful tune of Pomp and Circumstance
2015-05-11 14:08:46,1,0,1,Kingsman: The Secret Service,Kingsman The Secret Service Lots of blood gore death comedy violence and amazing use of music You will literally get lost in some of the fight scenes One part features the Free Bird guitar solo on an all out murder scene You Will Get Fucking Lost In Space at that part It comes to Digital HD in 4 days Do watch

2015-05-17 22:36:06,3,0,3,Kingsman: The Secret Service,I recently saw Kingsman The Secret Service and I must say my favourite 4th wall so far is when black dude with a lisp says  this aint that kind of movie And then the follow up to it later
2015-05-18 00:56:30,23,0,23,Kingsman: The Secret Service,Finally saw Kingsman The Secret Service Holy fuck was it good
2015-05-18 10:33:51,-9,0,-9,Kingsman: The Secret Service,I thought Kingsman The Secret Service was quite cheesy there was action and stuff but the humor was sad
2015-05-18 17:10:17,3,0,3,Kingsman: The Secret Service,1 Kingsman the secret service

2015-05-19 21:52:37,2,0,2,Kingsman: The Secret Service,Making movies that arent Kingsman The Secret Service I mean whats the deal you found the perfect film just keep making it
2015-05-20 03:31:25,0,0,0,Kingsman: The Secret Service,I dont think its really the butt sex joke that turns some people off in the final scene which is perfectly fine in my opinion  I think its the millions of dead children around the world  People latch onto plot holes in bad movies because its low hanging fruit  They find the most obvious thing to point out to show why a movie didnt work  Many great films have had glaring plot holes but you never notice because they only bother you if the rest of the movie is bad  Please be not mistaken Kingsman The Secret Service is in no way a bad movie  I just think theres something else at play here thats spoiling the mood for many people during that final scene
2015-05-21 23:31:16,3,0,3,Kingsman: The Secret Service,Id love to see Kingsman The Secret Service meet up with the gang from Kill Bill before she was a bride of course
2015-05-22 10:12:22,27,0,27,Kingsman: The Secret Service,Considering its the same choreographer from Kingsman The Secret Service Im hoping for some pretty awesome stuff from Batman
2015-05-22 11:36:48,1,0,1,Kingsman: The Secret Service,I love the church scene in Kingsman the secret service thats one that comes to mind
2015-05-22 17:32:28,1,0,1,Kingsman: The Secret Service,I LOVED the fightingfilmingediting style used in Kingsman The Secret Service
2015-05-22 22:42:40,2,0,2,Kingsman: The Secret Service,I think Matthew Vaughn also does a quite good job at this Kick Ass The Kingsman The secret service also helped produce Snatch Lock Stock and Two Smoking Barrels Also in those movies they use similar styles for example traveling in Snatch httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvwyKBSy6rgdY

2015-05-24 22:30:59,-14,0,-14,Kingsman: The Secret Service,The fact that people are calling The Human Centipede III disgusting and regressive toward woman are the same people who came buckets filled with jizz over Kingsman The Secret Service I find the hypocrisy amusing
2015-05-25 07:40:16,3,0,3,Kingsman: The Secret Service,Kingsman The Secret Service Much more than i thought it would be and had a great time watching it
2015-05-26 06:45:23,-2,0,-2,Kingsman: The Secret Service,Was about to mention this also I also feel  Kingsman The Secret Service should be classed amongst these raw action movies The church fight scene was enoughIll also add crank and taken to the listeven pacific rim deserves a mention
2015-05-27 05:19:01,25,0,25,Kingsman: The Secret Service,Church fight scene in Kingsman The Secret Service
2015-05-31 15:47:25,1,0,1,Kingsman: The Secret Service,Check out Kingsman The Secret Service also by Mathhew Vaughn
2015-05-01 05:09:36,0,0,0,San Andreas,As others have said some of us didnt get the Star Wars trailer  Its weird since Disney owns both Marvel and Star Wars now  At least we got the San Andreas 2012 2trailer
2015-05-01 16:24:56,1,0,1,San Andreas,Nope I had San Andreas Mission Impossible Fantastic Four Antman and maybe a few others
2015-05-01 19:53:19,0,0,0,San Andreas,Jurassic World AntMan Tomorrowland and San Andreas I wouldnt think Marvel would give their rival DC any screen time ahead of their headlining feature
2015-05-01 22:28:06,1,0,1,San Andreas,There was rougly 25 minutes of trailers for me it was awful San Andreas Tommorowland Ant Man Pixels Jurrasic World Batman Vs Superman and 2 others I cant recall
2015-05-01 23:44:16,1,0,1,San Andreas,I got a rock in San Andreas
2015-05-01 23:56:16,1,0,1,San Andreas,I got jurassic world tomorrowland antman san andreas pixels and terminator genysis
2015-05-02 01:12:48,1,0,1,San Andreas,I did not see the Force Awakens trailer at my LA showing I saw Antman Jurrasic World San Andreas and this ridiculous Adam Sandler vs Pac Man thing
2015-05-04 12:09:00,2,0,2,San Andreas,Yeah I agreenot that many people care that he is leading this Or will care that he is leading anything He just isnt on that level and never has been XXXs never took off Riddicks do pretty decent and Fast amp Furious doesnt even feel like tbh but I dont care about the series that much I have a feeling this will flopif it doesnt it will finish 50 mil above or below what it needs to make back This is the same scenario like Dwayne Johnsons My friend swears left and right that he is amazing and every single one of his films is good and does well We fight everytime because Dwaynes leading vehicles have proven that he isnt that wanted as a leading man He is best as the guy who hypes stuff up and adds a new leveldimension to already established franchises But Hercules San Andreas Faster Snitch Journey 2 They keep trying and trying lol I mean some end up being made decently or selling decently but not to the point of continuously beating this same nail
2015-05-04 17:09:35,10,0,10,San Andreas,For some reason in my mind when I see the title I see the rock in Gta San Andreas
2015-05-07 15:22:15,39,0,39,San Andreas,San Andreas was shot in 3D The Martian was shot in 3D The Hobbit movies were shot in 3D The Great Gatsby was famously shot in 3D
2015-05-07 21:58:49,1,0,1,San Andreas,And then voiced a crooked cop in GTA San Andreas
2015-05-09 08:58:14,1,0,1,San Andreas,Definitely natural disaster movies for me too The Day After Tomorrow 2012 Into the Storm etc Cant wait to see San Andreas on the big screen and how Visual Effects teams can fuck up a city in a gloriously spectacular fashion
2015-05-12 21:34:48,1,0,1,San Andreas,I dont think San Andreas is going to be bad a lot of CGI but I think poltergeist is going to be a lot better Sam Rockwell is an acting god
2015-05-13 18:13:22,7,0,7,San Andreas,Oh  yes Paul Giamatti from the amazing spider man 2 and San andreas
2015-05-14 01:51:03,1,0,1,San Andreas,Paul Giamatti The Amazing SpiderMan 2 San Andreas  this is the first ring of hell if that is how you know Paul Giamati
2015-05-14 02:08:52,1,0,1,San Andreas,Who the fuck thinks of The Amazing SpiderMan 2 San Andreas and Transformers Age of Extinction when they think of Paul Giamatti and John Goodman
2015-05-16 03:57:57,4,0,4,San Andreas,I was really hoping all of the trailers were going to be remakes but that stupid San Andreas movie ruined the streak
2015-05-16 19:31:26,6,0,6,San Andreas,I think this one could stay up in the top five for a long time while all the other big movies open big and then fall San Andreas Terminator Jurassic World for example  If it stays number two next week behind Tomorrowland thatll be a good sign
2015-05-16 19:43:32,3,0,3,San Andreas,2012 and the upcoming San Andreas might suit her
2015-05-16 19:52:49,2,0,2,San Andreas,Definitely good calls  Many Emmerich movies qualify and San Andreas looks good
2015-05-16 19:58:03,7,0,7,San Andreas,Tomorrowland yesI wonder how Fury Road will fare against San Andreas
2015-05-16 20:17:05,5,0,5,San Andreas,if you think San Andreas and a romantic comedy are huge summer vehicles in a summer with Terminator 5 Avengers 2 Mad Max 4 Jurassic Park 4 Ant Man Mission Impossible 5 Ted 2 Despicable Me 3 and Fantastic Four youre seriously deluded
2015-05-16 20:25:26,1,0,1,San Andreas,San Andreas is going to make tons of money The Rock is one of the biggest box office stars today and people love disaster movies
2015-05-16 21:49:59,-2,0,-2,San Andreas,San Andreas will crush the box office this summer Audiences love disaster movies and the Rock is a star Will probably be the surprise hit of the summer
2015-05-16 21:56:54,7,0,7,San Andreas,I saw Mad Max and it was amazing but I dont think word of mouth is gonna save it Next week Tomorrowland and Poltergeist come out and there are so many big movies in theaters that Mad Max wont do that well Plus the week after San Andreas comes out We can hope for 200 million worldwide by then end of its run which is still a very poor performance given how much money was put into the movie
2015-05-16 23:06:33,24,0,24,San Andreas,Not really Max will have great legs internationally Im not from the US but no one here Australia gives a damn about Tomorrowland or San Andreas And i havent heard may people from outside the US excited about them either Although Max wont do that well overall id put it 250300 Which is really good for an R Rated Movie But if it stays in the cinema as long as Kingsman has been in there for then maybe 350 isnt out of the question
2015-05-17 00:11:19,6,0,6,San Andreas,They barely even show trailers here for Tomorrowland Ive seen 2 out of the 10 times Ive been to the cinema and none of them have made us want to see it San Andreas just shows the same boring trailer that makes 2012 look good
2015-05-17 00:56:27,0,0,0,San Andreas,I hated 2012 and all those kind of action movies but I thought San Andreas looked all right
2015-05-17 05:28:41,1,0,1,San Andreas,I just mean it seems like San Andreas is to 2012 what Deep Impact was to Armageddon  Might be a fine flick in its own right but seems slightly copycatish with worse acting is all  A giant earthquake destroying LA and other places too  Thats new
2015-05-17 05:37:12,1,0,1,San Andreas,Wait actual human beings want to watch San Andreas I thought it was just for like crab people or something That movie looks dumb as hell
2015-05-18 04:49:50,3,0,3,San Andreas,Have  it be GTA San Andreas
2015-05-18 11:42:59,-1,0,-1,San Andreas,Im not aware of a website with that information  When I saw it the trailers were The Gift Jurassic World San Andreas Fantastic Four Terminator Genisys and Vacation  It was funny because 46 of those look like CGI shitfests juxtaposing MMFRs practical effects revival  It really mad the feature look even better because all the effects in those trailers looked cartoonish and fake in my opinion  Vacation actually looked like the best movie of the 6 to me which is surprising
2015-05-18 12:59:30,3,0,3,San Andreas,Take away Sinister 2 and Entourage Add The Transporter Refueled and San Andreas
2015-05-18 13:08:25,1,0,1,San Andreas,Did you saw Mad Max in german Only 3 trailers for a major release seems a low I got trailers for San Andreas Pixels Terminator AntMan Jurassic World  A World Beyond and The Last Witch Hunter But then again I watched Mad Max in english
2015-05-18 14:05:29,1,0,1,San Andreas,Mine had San Andreas and Magic Mike XXL Beat that
2015-05-18 15:32:18,1,0,1,San Andreas,San Andreas
2015-05-18 18:40:30,1,0,1,San Andreas,Sinister 2 The Gift Jurassic World San Andreas some M Night Shyamalan movie Fantastic 4 The Walk Entourage and I think I missed one or two I just remember there being a ridiculous amount
2015-05-18 19:20:20,1,0,1,San Andreas,I got terminator genysis jurassic world San Andreas and poltergeist
2015-05-18 19:53:35,1,0,1,San Andreas,I had all of those trailers but with San Andreas in the mix
2015-05-19 00:48:51,1,0,1,San Andreas,I had this except San Andreas and the new Terminator instead of The Walk Ant Man amp Vacation
2015-05-20 12:57:17,0,0,0,San Andreas,Ironically I was kicked out of my film and television class at University because they were filming a scene for San Andreas in the lecture hall Also another in the film labs using the camera I regularly used for television production as a prop Will be amusing to see it on screen even if it does look like Emmerichesque shite
2015-05-21 14:25:36,1,0,1,San Andreas,I wish San Andreas was called The Rock Fights an Earthquake
2015-05-22 07:33:21,1,0,1,San Andreas,The Richter scale does not stop at 10 There is no limit We have no idea what kind of energy the San Andreas fault or any other faults can generate We only have recorded data of past earthquakes which provides probabilistic information
2015-05-23 04:39:06,7,0,7,San Andreas,Im not certain how San Andreas is going to turn out yet but I really need to see 2012 meets The Rock
2015-05-24 10:52:04,2,0,2,San Andreas,Im not so sure about that Movies dont really have box office momentum anymore domestically anyway Age Of Ultron really ate into Fury Roads opening weekend Mad Max is now in fourth place and San Andreas is expected to make somewhere around 30 million next weekend
2015-05-24 16:55:46,0,0,0,San Andreas,I predict the Fault in our San Andreas bombing horribly
2015-05-25 16:14:46,0,0,0,San Andreas,This website is seriously sub par They describe logan lerman as being confirmed spiderman in an article about san andreas
2015-05-26 07:31:41,3,0,3,San Andreas,When I watched the trailer what kind of pissed me off was the line It will be felt on the East Coast which is just so ridiculous I understand that disaster movies are supposed to be over the top but an earthquake like that is basically off the scale The Earth might as well be splitting into two with something that has that much force Come to find out San Andreas doesnt even have the most dangerous fault that would belong to the Cascadia one right under the good ol state of Washington You could still have all the big skyscrapers falling and whatnot with a regular earthquake so to blow it up to those proportions needlessly makes me think If the movie producers cant even get the actual disaster right whats the rest of the film like
2015-05-26 10:18:33,1,0,1,San Andreas,Gotta say Duane Johnson look at the films he is in scorpion king Hercules gi joe fast n furious 67 San Andreas Only problem is he doesnt have catchphrases like nold does
2015-05-26 14:37:39,20,0,20,San Andreas,I havent heard a single person express any desire to see San Andreas so Ill go with that one
2015-05-26 15:06:09,5,0,5,San Andreas,Im sure San Andreas will do great in the box office The Rock will get people in the seats for sure and its a disaster flick which 2012 has proven to make back more than enough for being as mediocre as it was
2015-05-26 20:42:31,1,0,1,San Andreas,Dont forget Dwayne Johnsons San Andreas Should be a decent disaster movie
2015-05-26 23:25:24,2,0,2,San Andreas,Whose fault Whose fault The San Andreas FaulthttpswwwyoutubecomwatchvfGiueFRyKV8
2015-05-27 04:58:27,-7,0,-7,San Andreas,Its all about the IP these days And giving the IPs all female casts Seriously stuffing females in movies is not a feminist movement Its stunt casting Write strong female characters with proper motivations and real world relevance And thats all my problems with Hollywood Ill go see San Andreas this weekend though ahahah
2015-05-27 19:39:59,1,0,1,San Andreas,2012 is my guilty pleasure I wonder how San Andreas compares 2012 was pretty selfaware of how goofy it was though
2015-05-28 02:19:29,2,0,2,San Andreas,Laziest title would just be San Andreas review the title is groan worthy sure but not too lazy
2015-05-28 13:38:20,1,0,1,San Andreas,Pretty much every explanation they give is ITS THE SAN ANDREAS FAULT Its clearly not a smart film dont go in expecting one
2015-05-28 20:05:11,1,0,1,San Andreas,San Andreas also has a music video for Sias California Dreamin cover
2015-05-29 09:48:13,3,0,3,San Andreas,Not sure if you are describing 2012 or San Andreas
2015-05-29 11:02:43,2,0,2,San Andreas,its a movie not a science report the best movies arent 100  scientifically accurate Not saying San Andreas is good cause i have no interest in seeing it but Reddit has this giant boner over eveything being realistic which is just dumb Its a movie not a documentary
2015-05-29 12:56:19,-4,0,-4,San Andreas,It was entertaining but it was hardly the best Furious 7 and San Andreas were at least equally enjoyable And honestly this is the discussion thread for San Andreas The discussion for Mad Max was 3 weeks ago If you want to keep talking about it you can try the bazillion other threads that have been started the last month here or simply go to rmadmax
2015-05-29 14:58:20,7,0,7,San Andreas,what no they werent I understand youre tired of the circlejerk but San Andreas is not on an equal level with Fury Road in any respect
2015-05-29 17:18:55,3,0,3,San Andreas,Watch San Andreas Quake An enjoabley cheesy Asylum movie Me and my dad laughed the whole way through and enjoyed making fun of it
2015-05-29 17:38:26,1,0,1,San Andreas,Yup  San Andreas looks awful  Mad Max i enjoyed
2015-05-29 17:50:59,1,0,1,San Andreas,Well the point of encouraging audiences to change their behavior is to adjust what produces a hit movie  If audiences avoid stuff which gets mediocre reviews and seems to simply aim for mediocrity eg Tomorrowland San Andreas Transformers movies etc then those things will make less money and be less likely to get made
2015-05-29 18:03:02,2,0,2,San Andreas,I support good movies not just original ones Mad Max Fury Road was a rebootsequelremakeit is really unclear how this film relates to the other films but it is the best movie I have seen all year Being original is not the same thing as being good Tomorrowland is not the only original film playing right now There is also the Rocks San Andreas Rotten Tomatoes rate it 51 2 higher than Tomorrowland andAloha which is only 14
2015-05-29 18:24:48,6,0,6,San Andreas,I dont get that kind of reaction San Andreas delivers on exactly what it sets out to do The kind of movie you are expecting when you go see San Andreas is exactly what you get with a few twists that are surprisingly good like the girl being the protector of the others What else do you possibly want from it
2015-05-29 20:07:24,1,0,1,San Andreas,Just finished a marathon of all six Star Wars movies and the behind the scenes commentary which took me all daygoing out to the theater to relax and watch San Andreas because it looks fun and stupid
2015-05-29 21:12:22,14,0,14,San Andreas,gt He was willing to let characters die so that we knew that all his staggering visuals came at a price But San Andreas wants the applause without the tears offering no emotional impact just cool shots of streets splintering apart
2015-05-29 21:48:37,1,0,1,San Andreas,San Andreas Movie Review  Starring The Rock httpswwwyoutubecomwatchv0ES4CwMX0
2015-05-29 21:58:44,2,0,2,San Andreas,When I saw it all I could think was about the mass casualties and it made me appreciate their story more I think any realistic character would use whatever resources were at their disposal to save their daughter especially after having already lost one To me San Andreas felt pretty realistic in the sense that in the same situation nobody would really give a flying fuck about everyone else just their own family
2015-05-29 22:06:46,3,0,3,San Andreas,I personality dislike 3D movies because I  would have to wear 2 glasses watching them is San Andreas worth it to watch in IMAX 3D
2015-05-29 22:35:59,3,0,3,San Andreas,I enjoyed Hercules Love movies like San Andreas as well Cant wait to see it
2015-05-30 00:50:01,116,0,116,San Andreas,Everyone seems to think that the video is making fun of San Andreas but I thought it was clearly praising the film for going the extra mile and using a considerable amount of practical effects
2015-05-30 04:16:01,1,0,1,San Andreas,Is that supposed to be a huge surprise Hercules got less than 30 million opening weekend San Andreas is what Looking at 45 million at least right Marketing was way better
2015-05-30 06:07:19,1,0,1,San Andreas,I saw it alone tonight too First time seeing a movie alone too cause Dad wanted to see San Andreas So good So fucking good
2015-05-30 06:14:26,3,0,3,San Andreas,San Andreas Mad Max Fury Road and for the sake of three Interstellar
2015-05-30 06:54:07,-6,0,-6,San Andreas,Its a a movie about the San Andreas fault splitting how is the title bad It isnt the best title but It makes sense
2015-05-30 15:17:59,3,0,3,San Andreas,Its funny because so many of the movies listed here are considered to be as bad as or worse than San Andreas
2015-05-30 16:01:54,18,0,18,San Andreas,I think San Andreas might have some legs theres no other action competitors coming out until Jurassic World and I dont think the Entourage movie is going to shake up the box office Poor word of mouth could make it dip big time but The Rock is pretty dependable box office wise
2015-05-30 16:17:54,38,0,38,San Andreas,I could say the exact same thing about San Andreas and tween dudes wanting to see things go splodysplode
2015-05-30 17:01:31,121,0,121,San Andreas,Crazy thing is also that San Andreas cost a lot less than other big blockbusters only about 100 million which is shockingly low for a CGI destruction fest This is going to be a really profitable film Glad Rock is finally the movie star he should have been ten years ago
2015-05-30 17:33:40,26,0,26,San Andreas,When I saw the ads for San Andreas I was just thinking  oh wow another plotless end of the world movie Is it actually basically that or is there more to it
2015-05-30 17:56:24,16,0,16,San Andreas,My dad saw San Andreas last night I saw Mad Max I came out and said Woah you really bet on the wrong horse I spent the 5 minute drive trying to explain music being made from a man with a guitar that shoots flames on top of a semi and realized I sounded insane and stopped gushing
2015-05-30 18:01:52,45,0,45,San Andreas,I saw the movie Its basically watching San Andreas in total destruction and I have to admit it was glorious
2015-05-30 18:21:43,17,0,17,San Andreas,I think I might have accidentally went to the premiere showing of San Andreas on the 28th Saw it playing when I went in and decided to check it out I went in expecting a fun movie with lots of destruction I got exactly that If you expect anything groundbreaking youll be disappointed But if you want a fun movie where you can sit back and enjoy the ride to kill a couple hours with Id check it out
2015-05-30 19:15:54,7,0,7,San Andreas,here is your proof of how stunning san andreas looks
2015-05-30 19:49:36,2,0,2,San Andreas,No surprise there Rock is way too big now to have a movie fail Aloha is its a mess Crowe hasnt done anything good in a while Zoo was okay but thats just about it  it was okay and nothing more Im just glad that Mad Max managed to cross 100 million milestone domestic before San Andreas came on
2015-05-30 20:04:45,3,0,3,San Andreas,Looks like they all came out yesterday San Andreas will probably make a decent amount
2015-05-30 20:31:44,-1,0,-1,San Andreas,Why go to see San Andreas when you can to to see Mad Max for the sixteenth time I dont get it This world is doomed And its a good thing
2015-05-30 20:37:55,3,0,3,San Andreas,Doesnt surprise me The only thing I heard about Aloha was how whitey white white it was whereas for San Andreas Ive seen trailers for it in theaters Also The Rock
2015-05-30 20:57:16,1,0,1,San Andreas,The trailer for San Andreas is really impressive  Even if the movie is a flop that trailer will draw a lot of people I think
2015-05-30 22:07:14,-1,0,-1,San Andreas,I have never fallen asleep watching a movie in the theaters I fell asleep watching San Andreas last night
2015-05-30 22:14:11,3,0,3,San Andreas,Or you can look at the fact that Mad Max was up against another big summer opener in Pitch Perfect  San Andreas didnt have anything but Aloha opening against it
2015-05-30 23:47:09,2,0,2,San Andreas,Or maybe San Andreas had more star power no competition and was also plenty of fun
2015-05-31 00:18:38,1,0,1,San Andreas,I saw a late showing Thursday night of San Andreas wasnt too shabby  It wasnt an academy award winner but it was pretty intense at times and the story wasnt terrible
2015-05-31 01:10:29,1,0,1,San Andreas,gt San Andreas was one of those films that I thought
2015-05-31 01:49:14,1,0,1,San Andreas,Agreed I actually saw a trailer before San Andreas it was the early trailer though but it got me thinking  it makes sense a Terminator went back earlier to raise Sarah and so the timeline has changed so of course after Reese goes back in this film the future he knows no longer exists It also adds a deeper threat for Sarah now that even though she has a Terminator fighting with her she has three Terminators hunting her and Reese down and one of them is her damn son This gon be gud
2015-05-31 02:42:34,1,0,1,San Andreas,I found San Andreashttpmanapopcomfilmsanandreas2015review to be a lot of fun though I wish the disaster genre would retire the estranged couple will reunite during crisis trope
2015-05-31 04:08:20,1,0,1,San Andreas,Superman Returns was not a reboot but a sequel to Superman The Movie with Chris Reeve Thats why they chose someone who looks so similar and thats why Lex Luthor is lessevil genius and more comically small time supervillain Hackmans Luthor in the 70s was almost comedy it was so silly His plan was to make a fortune in real estate by bombing with san andreas fault with a nuke Sound familiar
2015-05-31 04:59:57,1,0,1,San Andreas,Its tense its visually amazing and it gets the heart going like few other genres I ended up seeing San Andreas at AMC Prime and the entire seat shake gimmick legitimately put the movie on an entirely different level
2015-05-31 05:19:03,2,0,2,San Andreas,Its not great I think Crowes heart was in the right place but it is his worst movie Id still watch this again than watch San Andreas disaster porn at least June is gonna be a great movie month
2015-05-31 06:30:56,-3,0,-3,San Andreas,I think you overestimate how much the Rock is really driving the notatallthatamazing box office numbers for San Andreas Its a typical summer disaster movie If the Rock mattered that much Hercules wouldnt have flopped People are going to see CGI buildings topple They could have put John Cusack in the main role and not missed a beat I mean they did already
2015-05-31 06:48:01,1,0,1,San Andreas,San Andreas Also any disaster movie
2015-05-31 16:00:37,10,0,10,San Andreas,Yeah its based on that time the San Andreas fault line destroyed all of California In all seriousness though it is somewhat based on the worst case senerio if the fault line decides to tear shit up
2015-05-31 16:34:28,2,0,2,San Andreas,Very impressive opening for San Andreas  quite a bit more than I expected The Rock plus massive CGdestruction is clearly a potent combination
2015-05-31 17:09:35,1533,0,1533,San Andreas,As someone whos never beaten story mode of Grand Theft Auto San Andreas how much of it will this movie spoil
2015-05-31 17:39:39,1031,0,1031,San Andreas,At the rate The Rock was succeeding in San Andreas Im surprised he didnt jump into the fault line to pull the ground back together and then tell the tectonic plates If I ever catch you shifting again
2015-05-31 18:24:24,53,0,53,San Andreas,science The San Andreas will never hit a 9anything on the richter scale Tsunamies from earthqueakes in california are impossible No matter how strong any earthquake is in california itd never be felt on the East Coast There is no way to predict earthquakes
2015-05-31 18:31:36,1,0,1,San Andreas,And Im saying that even with my guard down low and I enjoy the film for what it is and for entertaining me in certain parts Im still going to give it the analysis it deserves and not be lenient Just because Avengers 2 and San Andreas had great moments and entertained me at times does not mean they are getting better analysis simply because I enjoyed parts and decide to ifnore the flaws Look even with all of my favorite films I still notice the flaws and acknowledge them The only types I am a bit more accepting of are horror films that try and films that know what they are I want to add Marvel to it like everyone else but they just arent doing it for me
2015-05-31 18:54:04,3,0,3,San Andreas,San Andreas was cookiecutter apocalypseporn The actors were surprisingly good doing the best they could with a cheesy formulaic script Good casting alone saved this movie IMO
2015-05-31 19:17:00,115,0,115,San Andreas,Woah there buddy Armageddon is a goddamn classic Dont you dare put San Andreas in the same league with Armageddon Now with 2012 Sure
2015-05-31 19:21:57,1,0,1,San Andreas,San Andreas is entertaining doesnt mean its a great film or that the director is particularly talented
2015-05-31 19:30:36,1,0,1,San Andreas,Whether you like it or not is personal taste Tarantino is definitely talented though  I havent seen San Andreas so I cant comment on that  It looks boring as fuck though
2015-05-31 19:47:10,1,0,1,San Andreas,I hated 2012 and liked San Andreas D
2015-05-31 19:50:05,1,0,1,San Andreas,Heres my full review of San Andreashttpjkleebergcomreviews2015531sanandreas2015
2015-05-31 20:08:34,0,0,0,San Andreas,I cannot look at any likeness of Easy E and without seeing Ryder from GTA San Andreas
2015-05-31 20:13:33,28,0,28,San Andreas,The largest credible earthquake on the San Andreas Faulthttpsocalregioncomsan_andreas is around an 82 far below a 9 or greater Earthquakes of that magnitude are reserved for Megathrust or subduction earthquakes We do have a subduction zone offshore of California but it begins where the San Andreas Fault ends at the Mendocino Triple Junction North of there you have the Cascadia Subduction Zone which last had a major event in January 1700 producing around a 92 or so
2015-05-31 20:38:32,1,0,1,San Andreas,San Andreas is derivative and predictable but goes through the motions with enough camp brio to make it an entertaining watch  Its true that Tarantinos films are rarely predictable but they are wholly derivative  and its this that prevents him from being regarded as the great artist many believe him to be  Also he has made films that I think are as horribly misogynistic as anything made by Michael Bay for instance
2015-05-31 21:01:53,3,0,3,San Andreas,San Andreas
2015-05-31 21:11:05,1,0,1,San Andreas,GTA san andreas The movie
2015-05-31 21:15:15,-3,0,-3,San Andreas,Definitely anybody who has the chance should see the new Mad Max Its a combination of cars explosions and women I dont think there is 10 minutes in that film where there wasnt an explosion Well worth the watch Would totally advise people to not waste their time on San Andreas though Nothing original really just a bad movie
2015-05-31 21:32:12,1,0,1,San Andreas,This week I got to see Furious 7 and San Andreas I know were supposed to be mentioning the best film we saw this week but I thought Id bring up San Andreas because even though it isnt great it was a fun movie to watch in theatres and wasnt all that bad despite lacking anything special in the storytelling department
2015-05-31 21:43:00,6,0,6,San Andreas,If anything San Andreas was NWA The Video Game
2015-05-31 22:19:32,1,0,1,San Andreas,This week I watched San Andreas and The Strange Case of Dr Jekyll and Miss Osbourne Sort of a slow week for movies for me Id say Jekyll wins its older and much more interesting
2015-05-31 22:36:53,1,0,1,San Andreas,No ones saying hes a wonderfully talented actor whos getting shafted for recognition Just that hes getting miscast in roles like that in San Andreas
2015-05-31 22:53:55,1,0,1,San Andreas,You were saying he shouldnt get leading roles and Im saying he should He was miscast for San Andreas and Hercules was another bad movie but theres glimmers that he can do better
2015-05-31 22:59:44,1,0,1,San Andreas,San Andreas
2015-05-31 23:31:30,0,0,0,San Andreas,I went to the movies last night saw the poster for San Andreas and promptly paid to watch Mad Max again
2015-05-31 23:50:46,-1,0,-1,San Andreas,I dont understand this kind of response for liking a movie How come a movie is suddenly good if its what you expected to see Since when is being predictable a good thing If you predicted a movie to be a steaming pile of shit like San Andreas and you got a steaming pile of shit is the movie suddenly good No unless you have a feces fetish of course Also why is it a good thing when a movie turns your brain off Since when has that ever been a good thing Isnt that like falling asleep Dont people fall asleep or zone out when they are bored shitless Or do I just not understand basic psychology
2015-05-02 12:51:26,2,0,2,Song of the Sea,Firstly I agree that the pacing of the last act is rushed and that Song of the Sea is a better movie
2015-05-02 14:37:31,1,0,1,Song of the Sea,gt You also saw the superior Song of the Sea first Most of your criticisms seem to stem from comparing Kells to Song so I understand why youd be disappointed
2015-05-02 19:36:30,1,0,1,Song of the Sea,Productionwise very good but as far as storytelling goes it didnt leave a lasting impression Cant really remember what it was about Enjoyed Song of the Sea a lot more
2015-05-02 23:53:48,3,0,3,Song of the Sea,Just as good I think Kells has the better story but Song of the Sea is a bit more ambitious with what its trying to do Both do pretty similar things with the art and characters you can tell theyre really trying to make movies that people like while distinguishing themselves from Studio Ghibli and Disney
2015-05-09 23:27:28,21,0,21,Song of the Sea,Not just an English bias an American bias Song of the Sea and The Tale of The Princess Kaguya were amazing but the Academy voted for the crap their kids wanted to go see
2015-05-10 02:02:54,2,0,2,Song of the Sea,Oh my god Song of the Sea is the greatest animated film Ive seen in the last decade In fact Id even venture to say that its one of the best traditionally animated films of all time Im so sad that the Academy doesnt take animation seriously Its sad to see the countless hours and hard work that foreign animators do only to be over shadowed by the usually American juggernauts
2015-05-11 15:26:09,1,0,1,Song of the Sea,Song of the Sea
2015-05-12 13:31:21,1,0,1,Song of the Sea,Dont think it so much of an anime but Song of the Sea is worth checking out Loved Redline by the way The whole thing was hand drawn and it took them quiet a bit of time to make it
2015-05-12 13:36:25,1,0,1,Song of the Sea,Song of the Sea is worth mentioning because story wise its very Ghiblilike but the art style is very much its own thing
2015-05-13 06:05:01,1,0,1,Song of the Sea,Song of the sea
2015-05-16 13:14:53,3,0,3,Song of the Sea,Song of the Sea It has a great soundtrack too
2015-05-17 04:34:50,1,0,1,Song of the Sea,I loved Paddington but thought Song of the Sea was better
2015-05-21 03:40:20,1,0,1,Song of the Sea,I loved Song of the Sea  it really got underneath my skin Such a fantastic looking film too
2015-05-21 04:35:38,2,0,2,Song of the Sea,That would explain why Big Hero 6 won It certainly was popular  nicely made but not in the same league as Song of the sea or Kaguya in my opinion
2015-05-25 06:27:01,2,0,2,Song of the Sea,Song of the Sea and Ernest amp Celestine are wonderful animated films Just recently watched them with my much younger sister she is 12 and she loved them both
2015-05-25 20:56:05,6,0,6,Song of the Sea,The Secret of Kells and Song of the Sea Cant remember the studio name but you will dig it
2015-05-25 21:44:49,5,0,5,Song of the Sea,Song of the Sea Not anime but I see it as a What if Miyazaki were European movie
2015-05-26 05:28:46,0,0,0,Song of the Sea,Song of the Sea Based on the Celtic myth of the selkie May want to make you tearyeyed
2015-05-27 15:29:44,1,0,1,Song of the Sea,I havent seen BH6 yet but really have no desire to I know a lot of plot points about it already and no matter how much people hype it up I really cant get enthusiastic enough to check it out I am also a massive HTTYD2 fan and loved Song of the Sea and Tale of the Princess Kaguya so this is somewhat biased but still based on what Ive witnessed following the Oscars for the past few years Get ready for a lot of projection
2015-05-29 14:18:26,526,0,526,Song of the Sea,Dont look at me I supported Whiplash I supported Song of the Sea I supported Inception
2015-05-29 16:58:31,22,0,22,Song of the Sea,Song of the Sea was so so good Ive never heard anyone else mention it I thought it was really old and had no idea it had just come out
2015-05-29 23:35:28,2,0,2,Song of the Sea,Was song of the sea any good
2015-05-30 10:50:55,1,0,1,Song of the Sea,I highly recommend The Tale of the Princess Kaguya It was nominated along with Song of the Sea for Best Animated Film at the Oscars this year
2015-05-30 13:22:46,4,0,4,Song of the Sea,Calvary Song of the Sea The Secret of Kells
2015-05-02 18:13:38,2,0,2,Unfriended,Id rather sit through The Shining than Misery haha I have always found hotels creepy though I love the psychological horror Also I give anything an extra point fir trying something differentso Unfriended got a 65 instead of a 55 from me Im not a big fan of the current jump scare trend even though Insidious franchise is pretty good What type of horror does your gf like If she is into instant gratification and jump scares she will despise It Follows That film is psychological creepy tense and ambiguous in its themes and after thoughts Its not one of those you know the killer is coming it plays with its prey the prey thinks its ok then the killer pops up out of nowhere and kills This is more of a dont like it catch up and I love it Let me know how yall like it
2015-05-04 00:27:49,1,0,1,Unfriended,Unfriended
2015-05-05 02:42:11,4,0,4,Unfriended,Unfriended the whole film was a skype conversation  It had zero scare factor The characters lacked any personality they were just clich characters for a horror film Any time anything gory would happen the webcam would go all glitchy and you didnt see shit
2015-05-05 06:45:16,2,0,2,Unfriended,Yeah now I will admit that hype for big films always get to me and I jump on board But I never end up like them 100Furious 7 has a weak 3rd actAvengers 2 is a beautiful messetcbut I always love a good emotion driven film with great plot and character I dont mind Ex Machina Unfriended or It Follows these are just recent good  excellent experiences but thise much more fulfilling I want to see something great and remember it I dont want to pay to see something explode fly joke explode explode cliffhang Its borderline satisfying and boring but forgetton the next day It is the Oscar season and film festival films that make me happy I can kind if see myself in Phoenixs characterfresh off of a relationship and open to different options whether its attention love just whatever He gave his all just like a regular relationship but those damn insecurities would pop up at times and it was just hard to watch and beautiful to see that
2015-05-06 04:20:51,1,0,1,Unfriended,Top Ex Machina It Follows Cinderella Kingsman and Unfriended its a good step in the right direction for horror as in trying new things and different mediums
2015-05-06 19:40:41,3,0,3,Unfriended,I saw Unfriended today and this loud cunt because me was moaning about how he wasted 8 on it and how dull it was
2015-05-07 08:25:54,0,0,0,Unfriended,Unfriended I like the idea of the whole thing being over Skype and having a horror about teenagers that actually act like teenagers and although the whole thing was beautifully edited I just never got engaged enough with the characters to really care about them or what happened
2015-05-08 03:43:37,1,0,1,Unfriended,Oh just wait Unfriended 2 is happening and its going to be about online sexual harassment aka gamergate
2015-05-08 04:21:26,2,0,2,Unfriended,If anything hurts this movie its the trailer I have never seen the trailer before but I saw Unfriended tonight not knowing anything about it I loved it Then I watched the trailer its awful and 90 of it are scenes that werent even in the movie
2015-05-08 11:18:18,3,0,3,Unfriended,Any movie heavily aimed at teens Like blatantly Such as Unfriended
2015-05-09 18:24:10,1,0,1,Unfriended,UNFRIENDED movie reminds of another movie called Tormented
2015-05-10 15:14:34,1,0,1,Unfriended,American hustle Guardians of the Galaxy Unfriended inglorious basterds Thats all I can think of right now
2015-05-10 20:17:38,2,0,2,Unfriended,You took the words straight out of my mouth People love watching these huge epic action films with awhole bunch of CGI They arent patient enough to wait for a film to complete itself with practical effects Even if they are patient they may not care by the time its out I dont mind watching these mediocre films I even try to not judge as hard But it is too hard to go easy on one and hard on everything else Then I see everyone else jumping on the bandwagon and it makes me even hate the films more I cant wait for Oscar seasonand indie breakoutsand just films that try experiment or do something to deserve to be watched Even if it is mediocre like Lucy and Unfriended they tried I dont think this trend will ever end though There are the people who like to escape in cinemas and people who dont mind dscaping but can relate to realism more
2015-05-10 23:04:37,1,0,1,Unfriended,15 year old here went to see Unfriended today in the UK its rated 15 can confirm that teens really do suck Had a similar experience with a load of idiots who wouldnt stop talking
2015-05-11 00:23:35,2,0,2,Unfriended,The only film I had time to see this week but I saw Unfriended and I was shocked at how much I enjoyed it The trailer for it are awful because they are filled with scenes that arent even in the film and the tone of the trailers isnt even close to the tone of the actual movie
2015-05-14 01:02:44,7,0,7,Unfriended,Movie looks so cool Not to bash The Guardian or anything but theyre the same people that gave Unfriended a 45 so
2015-05-14 01:15:26,1,0,1,Unfriended,Unfriended was actually pretty unique I thought Almost the same way Scream breathed life back into a stale genre when it came out
2015-05-14 02:42:01,3,0,3,Unfriended,Far from great but Unfriended
2015-05-15 00:17:14,1,0,1,Unfriended,Pretty much every critic that I follow said that Unfriended actually worked I havent seen it but the consensus is that it vastly exceeded admittedly low expectations
2015-05-18 12:05:44,1,0,1,Unfriended,Seeing it tomorrow Have seen Avengers It Follows Kumiko the Treasure Hunter Ex Machina Fifty Shades of Grey Furious 7 Spongebob 2 Cinderella Chappie and Unfriended though Kingsmans still my favorite probably followed by Kumiko and Ex Machina
2015-05-19 10:06:25,7,0,7,Unfriended,Having cleaned the screen at the end of Unfriended several times it struck me as odd that the end credits song is a guy rapping about how his faith in god led him from working in a convenience store to having a rap career
2015-05-24 17:31:38,4,0,4,Unfriended,unfriended
2015-05-24 22:37:16,1,0,1,Unfriended,Unfriended is however about the zeitgeist Its a horro movie that takes advantage of what scares us today rather than traditionally Its aim is to scare a modern audience and it certainly did that for me Its a smarter and better movie than a lot of people Including myself thought it would have been without watching it and the fact that it wont age well might be true but should not affect how we view the movie now
2015-05-25 21:32:18,2,0,2,Unfriended,Unfriended
2015-05-26 09:54:09,1,0,1,Unfriended,I watched Unfriended yesterday at the cinema I was really impressed with how they managed to create a good film it wasnt amazing with such a simple plot and the whole film was in real time The hour and a half it takes to watch the film is an hour and a half for the characters The film is also just a computer screen meaning you get to see all of the main characters messages Facebook profile and other internet things I really like the innovation people are taking with films nowadays especially as an aspiring film editor the film doesnt necessarily need to be good as long as its fresh and entertaining
2015-05-28 10:37:22,1,0,1,Unfriended,And Unfriended
2015-05-29 16:29:39,2,0,2,Unfriended,I think studios need to stop caring about opening weekend and consider long term success I dont know how well financially it is doing but Unfriended seems to be playing a modest one or two shows a night in my local cinema while larger films have come and gone
2015-05-29 18:06:14,1,0,1,Unfriended,I dont know the exact numbers but it seems like original films have been on the rise in the last few years Granted the quality varies but off the top of my head Grand Budapest Hotel Tomorrowland Ex Machina John Wick  The Raid Redemption Unfriended Frozen Transcendence Earth to Echo Interstellar Chappie The Man with the Iron Fists Green Inferno Tammy Jupiter Ascending Pixels The Hateful Eight etc Like I said varying quality and I guess success but mostly successful
2015-05-30 07:07:56,1,0,1,Unfriended,The Shining could be about anything Unfriended could be a rom com The Conjouring Maybe a movie like The Prestige
2015-05-06 20:58:07,1,0,1,Far from the Madding Crowd,The new Far from the Madding Crowd springs to mind
2015-05-11 17:21:46,1,0,1,Far from the Madding Crowd,In the last 7 days Ive watched Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome The Battered Bastards of Baseball Far From the Madding Crowd 2015 Spooks The Greater Good John Wick and Big Game
2015-05-11 19:50:38,1,0,1,Far from the Madding Crowd,I think the trailer for mad max is pretty bad too TBH I loved MM2 when I was younger but having seen the trailer twice in the past few weeks once before Far From the Madding Crowd which is hilariously off target audience but anyway I thought it just looked like complete nonsense and like they took MM2 and 21st century hollywoodised it
2015-05-19 11:51:56,2,0,2,Far from the Madding Crowd,Ummm what are you talking about I dont know where you live but in my area adult dramas like Noble The Water Diviner Far from the Madding Crowd Woman in Gold and The Age of Adaline are all currently in wide release Then theres two stupid comedies hot pursuit Paul Blart one kids movie which are usually better than adult dramas anyway although Home which is currently in theaters probably is not whatever Pitch Perfect 2 is a postapocalyptic 80s action movie Mad Max and a superhero movie Avengers I know you were being hyperbolic about multiplexes being half superhero genre flicks but still we only have three or four a year is more emblematic of a modern trend than some sort of cultural genocide Treatment of females in movies overuse of digital instead of film stock and expensive 3D are more viral and more concerning trends in film
2015-05-20 03:15:08,1,0,1,Far from the Madding Crowd,Far From The Madding Crowd was just released
2015-05-30 15:41:45,1,0,1,Far from the Madding Crowd,I havent ever paid much attention to Sheen but he was great in Far From the Madding Crowd in a totally different performance could not believe it was the same person
2015-05-04 22:42:47,3,0,3,Run All Night,I dont remember there being any controversy about him dropping out besides scheduling conflicts so nothing surprising here I actually think Joel was a good replacement and enjoyed him in Run All Night and this allows Hardy to potentially pursue a more meaty role in the future
2015-05-11 20:15:49,1,0,1,Run All Night,Run All Night I didnt watch too many new movies this week
2015-05-17 06:17:33,1,0,1,Run All Night,In recent memory Run All Night Fifty Shades and Into the Woods
2015-05-22 00:34:58,1,0,1,Run All Night,Me and you are the same but sub Run all night with Ex Machina
2015-05-23 20:11:47,2,0,2,Run All Night,Saw a trailer for Run All Night the latest Liam Neeson Ok he tends to do samey stuff these days but why they had to give up so much of the story
2015-05-26 19:34:29,1,0,1,Run All Night,Haha no my problem is the usage of ridiculously cliched lines like that A similar line was also used by Denzel in Equalizer or Im getting too old for this used 5x by Bruce Willis in the latest Die Hard flick or pretty much all the dialogue between Liam Neeson and Ed Harris in Run All Night
2015-05-27 02:37:34,2,0,2,Run All Night,Run All Night was pretty fun
2015-05-01 02:13:22,1,0,1,Iris,I have the exact same feeling when I watch that scene cause for all I know both sides of my family ScottishIrish and Italian probably came over on the same boat
2015-05-01 06:36:55,2,0,2,Iris,The AI sounded Irish to me I dont think it was Delphy
2015-05-01 23:04:34,-1,0,-1,Iris,Sorry guys Im new to The Onions movie reviews and although I could tell that the review is not meant to be serious I didnt quite get what it was satirising Were his This space shouldve been filled with superheroes ramblings actually him ironically saying that there are too many superheroes in the movie
2015-05-02 00:40:56,3,0,3,Iris,Lazenby being an Australian and Brosnan being from the part of Ireland not still legally part of the UK get handwaved because Australian and Irish cultures still are interlinked with Britain due to historical and geopolitical trends
2015-05-02 05:18:10,1,0,1,Iris,Im nowhere near qualified to call myself a person of Native descent closest Ive got is that my fathers greatgrandmother was pureblood Choctaw  Im pale as a boiled Irish potato while Dad looked practically right off the reservation so instead as a person of taste who respects the dignity of my fellow human being may I say Kiss my ass Sandler
2015-05-02 10:42:10,2,0,2,Iris,I am IrishAmerican Not Native American I can still be outraged by the aspects of this though and I am
2015-05-02 12:35:41,1,0,1,Iris,Fuck those native americans I am tired of groups that cant take a fucking joke even a bad one Every joke in the movie should have been about how Indians are unemployed alcoholics Watch the shit hit the fan with the native american groups then Yet I cant tell you how many time I have seen the Irish portrayed in that light and no one walks off any movie sets or protests
2015-05-02 13:19:43,1,0,1,Iris,Nah native Irish His name is Bard Finn
2015-05-02 15:43:00,1,0,1,Iris,Okay I accept that Australia is has more political connections with the UK but Ireland just like the US is a former British possession with an elected head of state and like the US Ireland is not in the commonwealth However  I do accept that Brits have more in common with the Australians and until Brosnan became Bond I think precedence would have been a good reason for excluding Americans But allowing an Irish person in breaks that mould I think Irish people have a lot in common with both Brits and Americans Linguistically our vocabulary and spelling is more or less the same as the UKs HibernoIrish aside but pronunciation wise the Irish accent is far more like the American accent the common pronunciation of the letter r being the most notable So I think going from allowing an Irish Bond to an American Bond isnt too much of a jump
2015-05-02 18:07:26,2,0,2,Iris,Why did Starks FRIDAY suit AI change from an American to an Irish accent out of no where
2015-05-03 08:58:57,3,0,3,Iris,My wife is huge into Irish history and she says the art of Secret of Kells is vastly superior because of the direct inspiration taken from the artworkcalligraphy of time the Book of Kells was written I think theyre pretty similar but I was surprised to learn the Book of Kells is an actual book
2015-05-03 10:39:54,2,0,2,Iris,Can someone please explain to me why at the end Iron Mans operating system had a really awful Irish accent
2015-05-03 12:28:15,3,0,3,Iris,And then Kill the Irishman the last big budget film to actually take place in Cleveland was filmed in Detroit
2015-05-03 14:58:39,1,0,1,Iris,The actress is Irish
2015-05-03 15:03:16,2,0,2,Iris,The actress who provided the voice is Irish and was using a perfectly normal Irish accent not everyone will like her speaking voice of course but Im not sure what was awful about it
2015-05-04 04:18:53,1,0,1,Iris,Im not Irish so it shouldnt matter I think
2015-05-04 15:59:06,1,0,1,Iris,I get both the praise and criticism Its an ugly movie the cinematography and editing are as slapdash and idiotic as Bay has ever done But I think the mark he was going for  the whole American dream gone wrong and muscle man fetishism satirising is pretty spot on Its just a pity that the film looks as bad as it does
2015-05-04 21:26:44,9,0,9,Iris,This is cool and all But where is the irishman Scorcese has 1 more mob movie in him for sure
2015-05-04 23:26:15,0,0,0,Iris,No they wont I am hoping for Michael Fassbender and I hope that this movie is very noirish
2015-05-04 23:42:17,3,0,3,Iris,yup And its based on an AI he had in the comics Shes evidently Irish
2015-05-05 01:43:57,1,0,1,Iris,Fridays accent was cartoonishly Irish
2015-05-05 02:01:55,1,0,1,Iris,Not really Sinatra and The Irishman as well as Silence have been talked about for YEARS He could take on another Hugo after this for all we know
2015-05-05 02:05:48,68,0,68,Iris,This is the origin story where they say Temuera Morrison lied and Jango Fett had an affair with a Irish blonde lady on Kamino leading to Michael Fassbender being cast
2015-05-05 07:59:47,3,0,3,Iris,Fassbender is Irish
2015-05-05 11:57:03,2,0,2,Iris,This one has been in development hell for decades though its finally another intensely personal project for Scorsese The Irishman and whatever else can wait
2015-05-05 15:38:07,3,0,3,Iris,gt But you dont see where rape is The irish still remember
2015-05-05 15:56:21,2,0,2,Iris,I always heard that it was just propaganda on behalf of the EnglishScottishIrish They all 3 said that the other guys were so barbaric that they had this policy in place
2015-05-05 16:08:21,2,0,2,Iris,The Irish remember a thing that never happened
2015-05-05 19:10:44,1,0,1,Iris,I really hope he doesnt do that film and just does The Irishman instead
2015-05-05 21:34:26,12,0,12,Iris,Oh no please no Her accent is atrocious It sounds so fake even though she really is Irish
2015-05-05 22:26:17,1,0,1,Iris,i would love Punisher on Netflix Just read the MAX series and youll see a lot of material to do a few seasons easily Russian Slavers The italian mob The irish mob Barracuda So many great stories
2015-05-05 23:47:30,24,0,24,Iris,Brad Pitt nailed an Irish traveller accent in snatch
2015-05-06 01:16:52,1,0,1,Iris,I think he has an Irish AI now
2015-05-06 06:28:21,1,0,1,Iris,I thought Leonardo DiCaprio did well with the BostonIrish accent in The Departed
2015-05-06 14:30:55,1,0,1,Iris,I think the dudes great hes definitely gotten more and more Irish over the course of GoT
2015-05-06 23:46:39,24,0,24,Iris,I noticed Michael Fassbenders Irish accent slip out a bit towards the end of XMen First Class It was slight but definitely there Hes usually great with accents though
2015-05-07 00:29:34,16,0,16,Iris,His real would accent would slip out whenever he was doing scenes with the Irish
2015-05-07 01:40:13,2,0,2,Iris,i was hoping friday was voiced by that hot irish girl from season 3 of sherlock
2015-05-07 02:43:42,1,0,1,Iris,War of the Buttons 1994  Two gangs of Irish kids from opposing towns feud in mock but still very serious to them war against each other Makes for a fine doublefeature with The Sandlot 1993 in terms of kids movies that take their subjects as seriously as the kid characters do Which if anybody who was a kid can remember is exactly how serious you took absurd things when you were a kid  Kid
2015-05-07 03:14:40,2,0,2,Iris,Kill the Irishman  Awesome movie  He was also in both Thor movies
2015-05-07 03:58:20,8,0,8,Iris,He agreed to 1000 Ways to Die in the West on the condition he could continue to talk with his very heavy Irish accent
2015-05-07 04:47:45,11,0,11,Iris,That was because family guy did a joke about him being a cowboy with an irish accent a few years before so he thought it would be funny to actually do that
2015-05-07 05:05:28,1,0,1,Iris,To be fair there were a shit ton of Irish immigrants in the US at the time
2015-05-07 07:15:25,1,0,1,Iris,Come on man we want see the Irishman  but you could say he will borrow from himself doing gangster movie than boxing movie I dont think he will end up doing neither
2015-05-07 09:00:29,29,0,29,Iris,Daybreakers I love the idea of a world where vampirism was the norm like a sequel to I Am Legend but the film was awful Looked good though
2015-05-07 10:51:06,3,0,3,Iris,Wasnt he supposed to be Irish as fuck though
2015-05-07 11:05:19,1,0,1,Iris,To be honest now youve said that and listening to a scene now I guess he nails an Irish guy thats been living there for too many years
2015-05-07 11:40:14,1,0,1,Iris,Thats just what I assumed like all of Jack Nicholsons crew had hella Irish accents except Nicholson himself I think Im not great with accents but he had more of a Boston attempt
2015-05-07 17:36:43,5,0,5,Iris,He will be starring in a movie about the Irish Famine after this as he wants to focus on more serious roles you heard it here first
2015-05-07 18:04:09,1,0,1,Iris,They had him portray an Irish merchant specifically because he could not do a British accent One was easier for him than the other
2015-05-07 18:22:56,1,0,1,Iris,It wasnt a proper Irish accent either If they were happy to have it be a strange mutated jokey version of an accent they would have been happy for it to be a strange mutated jokey version of an English accent The reason why it was Irish was because he was an Irish TravellerhttpenwikipediaorgwikiIrish_Travellers
2015-05-07 21:17:00,2,0,2,Iris,Almost any Irish comedy does this They are advertised as straight comedies and are usually WAY darker
2015-05-08 01:00:45,-7,0,-7,Iris,No intelligent person could take a movie about the Irish Famine seriously unfortunately so that probably wont pay off
2015-05-08 01:34:04,3,0,3,Iris,We didnt run our country The UK did and it took most of the food such as beef butter grain etc Potatoes were what the mass poor society depended on especially in Winter we didnt own our fishing waters Most Irish people couldnt AFFORD FISH because of Englands laws Maybe actually read about it instead of mocking something you dont know anything about dipshit
2015-05-08 03:17:04,2,0,2,Iris,Yep Magneto is German  and Fassbender is actually GermanIrish Growing up he spent his first couple years and then just summers in Germany but lived primarily in Ireland Hes also lived in London since the earlymid 90s Thats why theres times where his accent slip will be distinctly Irish others where it sounds English and others like when hes angryMagneto where it sounds more distinctly German
2015-05-08 06:41:26,3,0,3,Iris,Reminds me of the psychotic black Irish guy in Ennis Punisher Kitchen Irish story Baddest black in Dublin
2015-05-08 22:16:50,2,0,2,Iris,Isnt that filmed in Ireland Im assuming North because frankly as an Irishgirl mixing up British and Irish here can lead to some choice words being spoken
2015-05-08 22:48:43,3,0,3,Iris,That guy with the AustralianSouth AfricanIrish accent in Django
2015-05-09 04:09:20,40,0,40,Iris,Christopher Nolan and Michael Caine In all seriousness though Pacino and Scorcese Baffling how they havent collaborated on something together Id love another Scorcese crime movie but with Pacino as the lead There were rumors of them making The Irishman together but so far they seem to be just that  rumors
2015-05-09 12:59:01,1,0,1,Iris,I thought he was finally doing The Irishman after Silence but I might be wrong about that
2015-05-09 16:03:46,1,0,1,Iris,The Guard and In Bruges are both really interesting and well written Irish films from the last few years
2015-05-09 17:02:35,2,0,2,Iris,American Psycho Excellent at satirising 1980s culture Great humourhttpswwwyoutubecomwatchvcISYzA36ZY but has a lot of tense thriller moments and lots of suspense as well Lots of action and gore
2015-05-10 08:40:21,2,0,2,Iris,Any Irish film
2015-05-10 17:48:32,3,0,3,Iris,She is definitely not Irish Shes some sort of monster
2015-05-10 19:38:09,1,0,1,Iris,Celtic mythology without the annoying bad Irish accents on all the nonIrish actors Celtic doesnt necessarily mean Irish The celts used to live all over Europe
2015-05-11 06:08:59,1,0,1,Iris,Really I thought that had about as much semblance to real life as a Loony Toons cartoon from the 40s An overthetop satirised highly coloured sensationalist depiction of his hedonistic and excessive lifestyle And it certainly didnt make me want that It made me question what the motive of the film was in the first place Because it does a whole lot for shock value and a whole little in terms of a coherent theme
2015-05-11 12:08:56,1,0,1,Iris,Its done in the same style as Baccano where theres the multiple intersecting storylines presented simultaneously except its in modern day Ikebukuro and instead of alchemists and homunculi we have irish fairies and cursed swords and instead of mafia wars we have colour gang wars and instead of Isaac and Miria we have a couple otakus with a van etc etc
2015-05-12 00:28:45,5,0,5,Iris,What about The Hunger from 1983 Catherine Deneuve bangs Susan Sarandon infects her with vampirism
2015-05-13 19:00:59,4,0,4,Iris,No way 28 Weeks Later ended with the Infected yet immune kids crossing the Channel into EuropeParis whereas it was only on Britain beforeluck of the Irish Last shot is a legit 100 Infected horde running towards the Eiffel Tower Shit is fucked again
2015-05-16 03:50:57,2,0,2,Iris,Yeah a lot of loose ends were left untied for the sake of just that I bet I just hope they keep up that metal appeal I thought the funniest and craziest part of the whole movie was the mobile sound stage with the gutairist with flames shooting out of his gutair Thats the stuff I love seeing
2015-05-16 06:29:45,1,0,1,Iris,Isnt there an Irish folk song that complements that pic
2015-05-17 02:44:15,1,0,1,Iris,Being a Brit with a lot of exposure to the Scottish and Irish finally paid dividends
2015-05-17 18:01:02,1,0,1,Iris,The Boondock Saints It felt like it was just specifically designed for people with a fetish for anything irish and not much thought put into anything else   Ive repeatedly tried to watch it over the years and just gave up eventually
2015-05-17 20:51:06,1,0,1,Iris,I know what you mean about the dialogue being impenetrable Have you ever spoken to someone who has a really unique pacing to how they speak Ive noticed this in Irish people personally and I remember the first hour or so around Irish people I really couldnt understand anything but then my mind just started to get the beat to their dialect and everything made sense Thats how this movie felt to me and why I am saying the first half hour is difficult while the diction was certainly out of the ordinary the pacing of the language is what left me disengaged at the beginning I can see how a familiarity with Shakespeare would make the movie more enjoyable although I dont have much if any familiarity apart from this film in fact writing this is making me realize I should rewatch it to see if the beginning works better for me now
2015-05-17 22:56:52,1,0,1,Iris,Well this one was said to be between mad max and road warrior so he isnt thunderdome legend yet but even then he never settled down He kept wandering after the children left and what not but the biggest thing is that he protagonist of the movie was both max and furirisa but like the last two movie the plot didnt revolve around max
2015-05-18 01:00:36,111,0,111,Iris,I wonder if he will go full Irish at some point like he did on the beach in first classhttpswwwyoutubecomwatchvHROuYFRJepQampfeatureyoutubeampt31
2015-05-18 16:25:28,3,0,3,Iris,Satire takes a concept and makes it hyperbolic for the sake of jokes it is the lynchpin of the argument the satirist  The premise in a satire inandof itself should not be a joke  I think that Mike Judges view of how the world is now is a narrowminded uninformed view of how contemporary society is  Hence his satire in my eyes doesnt work at all
2015-05-18 18:29:24,1,0,1,Iris,What an incredibly haunting movie Any other Irish films in the same vein that you can recommend
2015-05-18 19:15:09,2,0,2,Iris,Theres not really a lot of films in the same vein as this But some other good historical Irish films are Michael Collins In the name of the father and The General All examples of great Irish film making
2015-05-18 20:15:08,2,0,2,Iris,My favorite Irish film is Calvary Just saying Awesome film
2015-05-18 20:26:28,2,0,2,Iris,Agreed Its also an amazing look into the Irish psyche I dont know if you guys see yourselves that way but between Calvary and The Guard youve pretty much seen all of the Irish people though somewhat over the top
2015-05-18 20:43:19,1,0,1,Iris,Im English so dont see myself as an Irishman at all haha I can see what you mean about Calvary though ticks a lot of stereotypes from the traditional and modern Ireland
2015-05-18 20:45:06,1,0,1,Iris,Not just stereotypes but the mindset of the Irish A sort of dull tired cynicism The English have it too but theyre more lively about it Hard to explain exactly Fascinating peoples the lot of you
2015-05-18 22:56:39,1,0,1,Iris,Frankly Medivh was a legend the second he was born thanks to the way Aegwynn cut the Council of Tirisfal out of the equation
2015-05-19 00:55:14,10,0,10,Iris,You look like an Irish Matt Damon
2015-05-19 02:49:02,2,0,2,Iris,Caps notebook in the opening sequence of Winter Soldier had a list of pop culture references for him to catch up on The contents of this list differed depending on where the movie was screened ie Australian screenings had reference to Tim Tams whilst the UK screenings listed the TV series Sherlock IWantToMakeASuperman wanted to know if they localised the voice of Friday in a similar fashion or if everyone got an Irish  whatever the word is
2015-05-19 12:31:33,1,0,1,Iris,The Cabin in the Woods is still on there I believe I havent seen it yet but I have heard great things about A Girl Walks Home Alone at Night The Exorcist is on there Tucker and Dale vs Evil is on there Not necessarily a horror film but its a lot of fun and it plays with horror clichs Grabbers is a fun little Irish monster film If you like films like Shaun of the Dead then you will enjoy Grabbers Event Horizon is a decent SciFi horror film Let the Right One In is absolutely great The Omen is on there Classic horror right there
2015-05-19 12:45:53,1,0,1,Iris,He did play Irish M Bison
2015-05-19 13:20:56,28,0,28,Iris,That wasnt an Italian accent Not even close That was old school Philly Irish and that movie was pretty brilliant if you actually take the time to consider the themes and symbolism involved
2015-05-19 15:23:33,6,0,6,Iris,Aidan Gillen seems to struggle hiding that Irish accent
2015-05-19 16:58:44,2,0,2,Iris,Since theyre Irish American I can imagine them having some IRA connections and paramilitary training might come from there
2015-05-19 18:13:39,1,0,1,Iris,it was an Irish mob
2015-05-19 22:11:36,1,0,1,Iris,Reminds of a tv recently Maybe TWD dont remember An Irish actress guest starred and used her normal accent and everyone criticized it Claiming it was awful even though it was genuine
2015-05-20 06:40:23,2,0,2,Iris,two suggestions from the irish corner but a few of the local language might leave other nationalities somewhat confused but i love them
2015-05-20 10:59:51,1,0,1,Iris,The Irishman and maybe also Scorseses Sinatra movie at this point
2015-05-20 15:38:46,2,0,2,Iris,Theres a lot of overlap between English and Irish too doesnt make them the same thing Theres a pretty big difference between Native American culture and Latino culture specifically Mexican in regards to Danny Trejo And not to pull some bullshit race card but Im half Mexican and grew up on a Native American reservation Theres plenty of difference to realize that perceptions and reality are two very different things in this case
2015-05-20 16:46:03,2,0,2,Iris,The Lady from Shanghai Maybe get an actual Irish guy in the lead Although on the other hand itll be tough replacing Rita Hayworth
2015-05-21 12:29:33,1,0,1,Iris,I Heard You Paint HousesThe Irishman from Martin Scorcese It is supposedly going to star Robert De Niro Al Pacino and Joe Pesci It was my understanding that it was going to be made a couple of years ago but Wolf of Wall Street and Silence were made instead I doubt it will come to fruition honestly
2015-05-21 17:24:49,2,0,2,Iris,The assassination attempt on the Irish mobster in Millers Crossing that is kinda synched to Oh Danny Boy
2015-05-22 03:33:43,1,0,1,Iris,What the fuck is with all the weird math A Ruler 30 cm long a goat 12 Irish men deep a mile the total circumference of penis inside OPs moms peephole on November 5th
2015-05-22 23:04:06,1,0,1,Iris,Ive been to a lot of movies and TF4 was the only movie Ive ever considered walking out of At 2 hours in I had a headache and was hoping for the ending to hurry up Nope there was another hour left That Irish guy was irritating no idea if he was actually Irish there were no likable characters Optimus was a whiny bitch throughout the movie they kinda ruined Kelsey Gramer for me and a whole lot more
2015-05-23 08:11:55,22,0,22,Iris,And in the book Red was also Irish with red hair hence the name he was in there after some insurance fraud plot went awry  tampered with a cars brakes and it got someone killed
2015-05-23 08:53:30,33,0,33,Iris,gt Maybe its cuz Im Irish
2015-05-23 13:35:33,-1,0,-1,Iris,The eyes dont look convincing at all Seems like the irises are too big and its distracting No Oscar for makeup on this one
2015-05-23 15:54:37,1,0,1,Iris,I believe in the book Red was an Irishman  They just kept his name for the movie  Not read the book but that is what I heard
2015-05-23 18:53:12,1,0,1,Iris,Bruh I always feel like white people conviently forget that the Italian and Irish were the orgininal gangsters People like whitey bulger prove they never went away White people are more likely to commit white collar crimes these days A criminal is a criminal and I hate how white people only talk shit about black criminals
2015-05-23 19:17:08,2,0,2,Iris,I guess you have a point Gordon Gekko for example was idolized by many who went to Wallstreet even though he was a fictional scumbag Also the Wolf of Wallstreet Its true that the Italian and Irish were the original American gangsters
2015-05-23 21:30:28,44,0,44,Iris,I enjoy how the natively Irish bloke Cillian Murphy is a brummy and the BritishNZ guy Sam Neill is Irish
2015-05-23 23:46:51,12,0,12,Iris,Sam Neill is from Northern Ireland  he was born in Omagh  Spent the first seven years of his life here Therefore its pretty fucking accurate that he plays an RIC man from Belfast and does a perfect Norn Irish accent
2015-05-24 00:49:09,4,0,4,Iris,Tommy Shelby is 100 Irish Its an Irish gang in Burmingham Thats why they have Irish accents and drink Irish whiskey

2015-05-25 21:26:02,1,0,1,Iris,But more dramatic but its from McDonaghs brother so its got that stinging dark irish wit from time to time
2015-05-26 02:12:59,127,0,127,Iris,Whitey Bulger is an Irish Mob boss who evaded capture for decades Fascinating story which should translate well to the screen
2015-05-26 04:31:30,1,0,1,Iris,Waking Ned Devine Whenever I am sad or lonely or need to just feel good I like to watch this movie There is no unnecessary drama no angry dialogue no senseless violence and very little negativity This is simply a fun light story with good characters an amazing Irish backdrop and is just so beautiful
2015-05-26 14:36:29,11,0,11,Iris,yes Infernal Affairs but the screenwriter William Monahan adapted it to fit Bostons irish gangsters of which Whitey was top dog for about 30 years

2015-05-31 07:02:43,6,0,6,Iris,From my understanding The Irishman has Scorcese DeNiro Pacino Keitel  Pesci all attached
2015-05-31 07:55:19,13,0,13,Iris,He is hes working with De Niro and hes getting Pesci out of retirement to do a role Pacino is also in it and its called The Irishman Not much has been said but it could well be a gangster movie

2015-05-31 17:08:45,1,0,1,Iris,The Maysles documentary Iris Really enjoyed it Iris Apfel is a delightful subject and the movie as a whole was charming
2015-05-31 17:16:07,2,0,2,Iris,not sure if attempt to be vulgar or irish
2015-05-31 22:51:00,1,0,1,Iris,He actually had a different accent as a child which at the time was considered too low class to give him a chance as an actor He basically relearned how to speak with great effort to hide his working class YorkshireIrish roots for his careers sake His diction is a product of serious effort
2015-05-03 15:50:24,6,0,6,Maggie,Maggie SelfLess Criminal Southpaw have all interested me
2015-05-04 00:35:29,0,0,0,Maggie,So if Maggie Gyllenhal was playing Harley Quinn and dressed the same way  youd still think the costume was good
2015-05-04 00:41:13,-3,0,-3,Maggie,Now I know youre lying NOBODY thinks Maggie Gyllenhal looks hot  I just busted your argument all over
2015-05-06 11:52:15,1,0,1,Maggie,Sigh Wasnt in time for this and they arent screening Maggie in my country as well
2015-05-06 17:38:01,119,0,119,Maggie,I dont know about worst of all time but the one that really bothers me is Maggie Gyllenhaal in The Dark Knight Not that Katie Holmes performance was oscar worthy but Gyllenhaal was the worst part of that movie
2015-05-06 17:51:39,39,0,39,Maggie,Yeah I really like Maggie as an actress but her tone was just off That said I think s her death scene was very well done
2015-05-06 18:19:18,24,0,24,Maggie,Go see Maggie then such a departure for him Its really good
2015-05-06 20:38:02,27,0,27,Maggie,I never understand the hate for Maggie Gyllenhall But only two comments below people are commenting on the looks They never do that with actors
2015-05-06 20:58:50,17,0,17,Maggie,I feel like Im taking crazy pills when I see person after person say that shes unattractive Maggie Gyllenhaal is very attractive
2015-05-06 21:51:03,3,0,3,Maggie,The Last Stand It has this moment about two thirds of the way through when he finally gives up his backstory It was a chance for him to show a new path But suddenly it stops and cuts back to the idiot driving a car really fast It was such a shame I hope he does give proper acting a shot and Maggie is all its cracked up to be
2015-05-07 01:44:27,-1,0,-1,Maggie,I think a lot of it had to do with how she portrayed the character There was nothing likeable about her At least with Katie in the first movie she showed compassion and some sense of understanding With Maggie she came off as a bitch the entire time in my opinion Given that I dont find her attractive in the least and the finest part of acting in the movie was the Joker saying And you are beautiful it really bugged me how Bruce and Harvey got all broken up when she died She was an asshole and theyre better off
2015-05-07 03:48:31,1,0,1,Maggie,Maggie Gyllenhaal is better than Kattie holmes period Maggie is woman with strong will which I never see in holmes at all
2015-05-07 19:30:16,1,0,1,Maggie,The hate for Maggie Gyllenhall comes entirely because shes not classically attractive  Thats it  If she was hot people would be gushing over her acting and strong persona in many films
2015-05-08 21:34:13,30,0,30,Maggie,5 out of 5 youre forgetting his work as Maggie Smith in Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire
2015-05-09 01:30:54,1,0,1,Maggie,Maggie cant wait to watch it
2015-05-09 13:34:50,0,0,0,Maggie,It can require a suspension of disbelief that is too extreme to accept though  For example in shows and movies set in Pittsburgh one never hears a Pittsburgh accent  Not everyone in Pittsburgh has one of course and its less common around young people but youre not going to go through a day or a scene without hearing one  The 2007 TV show The Kill Point with Donnie Wahlberg was the first time I noticed this    none of the cops robbers or citizens had a Pittsburgh accent and some even had New York ones   The 2012 movie Wont Back Down starring Maggie Gyllenhaal is another good example especially considering how hard the movie tries to portray her character as a typical Pittsburgher
2015-05-09 14:47:55,25,0,25,Maggie,I dont want to hate this movie because it doesnt seem lazy like all of Arnies comeback movies but its just really dull and the drama falls realllly flat Maggie is a really uninteresting character and I didnt buy the relationship between Arnold and Maggie at all which was mainly the scripts fault
2015-05-09 16:49:17,21,0,21,Maggie,Just finished watching Maggie The film is basically about the final few days of Maggies life with her dad before she is going to turn into a zombie I really like this take on the infection it takes like weeks for them to turn and civilization isnt just over because there is a zombie outbreak Like it actually looks like things might be alright
2015-05-09 17:55:42,6,0,6,Maggie,I thought it was decent but the scene where Maggie takes one last trip to the lake with friends bothered the shit out of me  First of all theres a fucking zombie apocalypse nobody is going to be taking night time trips to the lake  Secondly even if they did they sure as fuck arent going to be bringing a soon to be zombie with them
2015-05-09 18:05:08,0,0,0,Maggie,Pretty dull The movie set up Arnold as having a bad ass reputation I expected him to handle things more methodicallydont think he would have had the stepmom even stay Yet have his moments of emotional connection Maggie didnt develop enough they could have explored her friendships more thoroughly and even maybe an end of life plan for her amp Trent together Just seemed like a lot of missed opportunities
2015-05-10 00:00:21,1,0,1,Maggie,Nope Miami Beach Cinematheque is in the middle of gushing over the Benoit DebieNicholas Winding Refn circle while O Cinema had not been playing Maggie Only theater to catch it is at the AMC in Aventura
2015-05-10 03:41:30,1,0,1,Maggie,Does anyone know if this was shot on film I checked IMDb and the technical specs are pretty sparse to say the least Im curious because Im watching it and listening with headphones and about 45 minutes in is a scene with Wade and Maggie outside while Wade is working on his trusty old truck Its a quiet scene and I can hear what I think is a film reel spinning If thats indeed what Im hearing its pretty neat and I cant remember the last time I had heard that in a movie
2015-05-11 14:54:16,1,0,1,Maggie,Maggie Arnold was fantastic in this movie Nice to know that he can actually act instead of just delivering one liners over and over
2015-05-11 15:21:36,1,0,1,Maggie,The theater in Alderwood where I saw Maggie yesterday had like 4 or 5 of their 13 theaters playing Avengers Come on guys its good but not THAT good
2015-05-12 12:36:58,1,0,1,Maggie,I didnt Enjoy it thought personally the pacing was very slow and had me out of it for most of the film Schwarzengger was decent in a dramatic role really hoped for better As for Abigail Breslin she really didnt have a strong lead to feed off of but carried her own in the film better than i expected When i saw the trailers i got really interested in the film it really failed to deliver with a premise for what I though was destined for great potential Ultimately the film is boring and slow if you walk into this film expecting quality acting youll be disappointed because everyone is for the most part decent MAGGIE is visually great as it does carry masterful cinematography
2015-05-12 16:54:52,5,0,5,Maggie,Its supposed to feel like there is no urgency Arnolds character is spending time with his daughter who only has a couple weeks left to live The movie was not supposed to be about the zombie apocalypse but how a father and daughter come to grips with death approaching And Id have to say his acting is pretty good He is stoic and at times has no idea what to say to Maggie
2015-05-12 20:40:39,6,0,6,Maggie,One of my favorites is Lockout with Guy Pearce and Maggie Smith Its not fantastic but its got great action sequences cheesy future highway chase scenes and is basically Die Hard in space Its on Netflix Check it out
2015-05-13 00:55:51,3,0,3,Maggie,check out Mommy Inherent Vice and Maggie
2015-05-14 01:50:34,25,0,25,Maggie,I always felt like Katie Holmes and Maggie Gyllenhaal felt out of place in Batman Begins amp The Dark Knight
2015-05-14 03:01:32,6,0,6,Maggie,gt Maggie Gyllenhaal
2015-05-16 11:53:18,1,0,1,Maggie,It seems like if Alex and Maggie spent some time exploring the universe then had a kid maybe a nerdy but rebellious daughter shed plausibly be about collegerecruiting age now
2015-05-17 05:01:47,1,0,1,Maggie,I dont know that I would say that Maggie is necessarily a good movie  It certainly wasnt enjoyable at least in the traditional sense for me to watch  But it actually got an extremely emotional response from me  I have two young children and I am a big softy kind of dad  By the end of the film the tops of my cheeks were sore from me keeping myself from bawling  Anytime a movie can illicit such a visceral reaction is notable to me  The movie must have hit the right tone to allow me to put myself in Wades situation  Pacing and character development are obvious flaws but if a film can draw me in the way Maggie did then it must be doing something right  I doubt Id watch it again and it certainly wont provoke happy memories  However it was affecting and interesting which in my opinion makes the movie a success  I dont know how to put a metric on that so blue out of five stars
2015-05-17 18:45:28,1,0,1,Maggie,Im loving recent Gyllenhaal from Maggie and Jake
2015-05-19 00:33:10,-1,0,-1,Maggie,maggie bombed because a large portion of people who enjoy zombie flicks may not appreciate the soft heart story

2015-05-19 18:46:14,-1,0,-1,Maggie,His newest movie Maggie was pretty awful
2015-05-20 01:36:23,77,0,77,Maggie,I know Alicia Silverstone is still active but I havent seen her in anything in forever Maybe people just assume Maggie Lawson is herhttpcdnfunniestwpcontentuploads201309MaggieLawsonvsAliciaSilverstonejpg
2015-05-20 04:18:32,39,0,39,Maggie,Incidently I hope Maggie Lawson now gets a lot more work She was great on Psych and in a guest role on Justified
2015-05-20 10:50:35,-1,0,-1,Maggie,Maggie Lawson is the one on the right
2015-05-20 15:21:48,4,0,4,Maggie,I agree I think Maggie Gyllenhaal is a good actress at times but she was miscast Shes not exactly beautiful and I cant imagine two guys fighting after her Katie Holmes I can definitely see
2015-05-21 08:26:10,-7,0,-7,Maggie,Have you seen Maggie
2015-05-21 08:39:11,-13,0,-13,Maggie,I think we can all agree the less movies Maggie Gyllenhaal is in the better
2015-05-21 08:46:46,12,0,12,Maggie,Agreed Arnolds acting chops actually seem to be improving with time  But it just seems hard for him to put butts in seats like he used to be able to  Hes very popular here at reddit and on Facebook and on Twitter but when it comes time to actually get people to pay money to go see one of his movies he seems to be struggling lately eg Sabotage was a box office bomb Maggie looks like its going to be a box office  VOD bomb too unfortunately  I say that because I like the guy as an actor and would enjoy seeing him get a second wind in his career
2015-05-21 08:58:08,5,0,5,Maggie,I didnt mention Dark Knight because Im not the biggest fan but I remember reading that Katie Holmes turned it down because she wanted to make Mad Money instead I thought Maggie played Rachel better
2015-05-21 09:04:51,1704,0,1704,Maggie,To be fair if we are going by the pics  provided in that specific article Monica Bellucci looks WAY better at 50 than Maggie Gyllenhaal does at 37
2015-05-21 09:05:42,0,0,0,Maggie,True sometimes youre famous enough to become non description action movie dude Maggie unfortunately isnt even close to being famous enough to be requested for random  white lady who looks 10x older than she is roles
2015-05-21 09:20:17,25,0,25,Maggie,Monica Bellucci might of had a little botox shes not going under the knife If she has then shes found the greatest surgeon in the world I think Maggie is pretty but Monica is just one of those women
2015-05-21 10:08:04,81,0,81,Maggie,Didnt the Joker make the bulk of those statements Somebody who presumably never met her  I found it weird as well even forced Nobody made those comments in batman begins with Katie Holmes playing the part why do so with Maggie
2015-05-21 10:08:35,104,0,104,Maggie,Actresses are expected to be beautiful Maggie isnt Hollywood Beautiful but we the viewer are expected to believe shes some bombshell because a billionaire playboy wants to be exclusive with her Its weird
2015-05-21 10:41:47,61,0,61,Maggie,Youre missing the point  Producers mostly combine young women with older men no matter the situation or how the bookscreenplay was written  Its a matter of judgement  Apparently the hottest girl still sells tickets without having to be proven as a talent in acting or stage drama  That is the point  Maggie Gyllenhaal has talent and good acting chops to be judged solely on looks is demeaning and stupid  On top of that She doesnt even look bad  I suppose in the womansphere of acting she would be considered a normal look person portraying a character actor only meant to bring massive amounts of talent to a role instead of the perfectly symmetrical expectations producers and people want  Basically the Phillip Seymour Hoffman of women if that makes sense
2015-05-21 10:43:44,-6,0,-6,Maggie,Its not because Hollywood doesnt want them its because people arent interested in them so Hollywood doesnt bother Why on earth would Hollywood bother with Maggie when Elizabeth Olsen Emilia Clarke Margot Robbie etc are constantly trending in the top 15
2015-05-21 10:45:36,51,0,51,Maggie,Well its Maggie Gyllenhaal she looks 1015 years older than her actual age
2015-05-21 10:46:59,19,0,19,Maggie,This is definitely exacerbated by the specific person Maggie Gyllenhaal has the facial makeup of an elderly woman Her face is defined by it to the point where in The Dark Knight when the Joker was talking about how beautiful she was it ruined my suspension of disbelief because she really isnt
2015-05-21 10:47:03,4,0,4,Maggie,Maggie was pretty good It was a nice change for the zombie genre And Arnie was great in it
2015-05-21 10:53:27,-6,0,-6,Maggie,Which part of Maggie Gyllenhaal looks old for her age You may find her unattractive but that doesnt make her look old and certainly not too old to pair with a 55yearold man Hell I didnt even know she was 37
2015-05-21 10:53:59,5,0,5,Maggie,Im just going to say it since no one has Maggie has an older looking face She could pull off 40something in this picture
2015-05-21 10:54:16,64,0,64,Maggie,Maggie Gyllenhaal At 37 I was too old for role opposite 55yearold man
2015-05-21 10:54:53,40,0,40,Maggie,Maggie looks way older than 37
2015-05-21 11:02:07,8,0,8,Maggie,Maggie is a terrible choice to center this article on Idk how old she is shes just plain unattractive She looks like a sad turtle
2015-05-21 11:04:09,3,0,3,Maggie,Hollywood is held to a different standard Maggie Gyllenhaal maybe not today but ive always liked her looks has always been regarded as meh looking but shes still spent most of her career more attractive than 80 of the women Ive ever seen
2015-05-21 11:04:26,4,0,4,Maggie,Because men are more visually stimulates not to mention even if women arent Brad Pitt is still sexy Nonetheless Brad Pitt invokes memories and fantasies on women Maggie makes men go meh
2015-05-21 11:07:03,-1,0,-1,Maggie,Its not an issue Its just maggienrealizing shes not very attractive
2015-05-21 11:11:07,0,0,0,Maggie,This is exactly the kind of fucked up attitude I expected from reddit Yes beautiful people get further in the world but what that guy was talking about isnt expectation its entitlement Every single thread involving Maggie Gyllenhaal devolves into another discussion about how she isnt very attractive  for Hollywood
2015-05-21 11:11:22,1,0,1,Maggie,I would view it as the casting directors simply didnt even consider older women for the roles Its not like if Maggie didnt audition they would have given it to an older woman They were never interested Shes just mentioning it now because its something shes noticed in her own experience later in life Youre not born knowing everything
2015-05-21 11:12:25,446,0,446,Maggie,Hilarious that this was left out of the article It was either intentionally done so to stir up more controversy or left out due to little to no research Also disappointing that Maggie would get angry because she cant pass as someone in her 20s
2015-05-21 11:12:48,2,0,2,Maggie,I dont particularly like Maggie Gyllenhaal but I preferred her a great deal over Katie Holmes
2015-05-21 11:15:45,140,0,140,Maggie,Maggie looks like an aging basset hound I think shes a great actress but
2015-05-21 11:16:32,12,0,12,Maggie,her husband is 7 years older than she is hey Maggie why arent you dating a 23 year old guy
2015-05-21 11:17:54,4,0,4,Maggie,To be fair Maggie looks awful with short hair
2015-05-21 11:17:56,18,0,18,Maggie,Because Brad Pitt doesnt look nearly as old as she does same thing goes for Monica Bellucci Maybe its not about looking old or not but sex appeal and tbf Maggie Gyllenhall has none There are many many actresses older than her that I would cast before in a role where sex appeal is required
2015-05-21 11:17:59,5,0,5,Maggie,Monica could be 60 and I would still choose her over Maggie looks wise
2015-05-21 11:20:22,1,0,1,Maggie,I have never used the word attractive for Maggie Gyllenhaal She always looked like a 60 year old aunt
2015-05-21 11:21:13,1,0,1,Maggie,Youre saying maggie gylenhall isnt motivated enough to be attractive I dont see how thats anyones fault but hers
2015-05-21 11:22:34,-9,0,-9,Maggie,Seriously dont get why this isnt the top comment All these self righteous pricks going on as if Maggie Gyllenhaals fighting for equality are missing the ACTUAL issue at hand She managed to get a story out of nothing and the people who wont bother to look into it will see her as some sort of martyrffs
2015-05-21 11:24:44,14,0,14,Maggie,idk why you are getting downvoted Maggie lookslooked like the crypt keeper Especially when they recast Katie Holmes role with Maggie No amount of make up can help sorry but its the truth Shes got an old face

2015-05-21 11:28:27,2,0,2,Maggie,Monica Bellucci is still one of the most beautiful women on the planet at 50 so its hardly a fair comparison for just about any actress out there much less Maggie Gyllenhaal
2015-05-21 11:29:23,-4,0,-4,Maggie,Maggie Gyllenhaal is foxey as all hell and I wont hear dissenting opinions
2015-05-21 11:31:15,5,0,5,Maggie,That would only be true if the roles had been intended for older actresses then 18 year old Maggie Gyllenhaal somehow managed to be seen for a role she was 20 years too young for and convinced everyone involved to change the character
2015-05-21 11:31:27,51,0,51,Maggie,Hmm I think Maggie Gyllenhaal might be 37 and its a long shot but I think she might have been considered too old to play the lover of a 55 year old man
2015-05-21 11:31:57,3,0,3,Maggie,Sandra Bullock CASE IN POINT 50 yo hot as hell Maggie looks like cheese sliding off a pizza

2015-05-21 11:41:04,4,0,4,Maggie,Maggie and the article are the ones claiming she didnt get the role only because of her age Reddit is just calling both of them out on their BS
2015-05-21 11:42:13,2,0,2,Maggie,Even if it is for a different movie  Its not the producers fault If she is the love interested in the movie it isnt pulling many guys into seeing it Rachel McAdams who is about the same age would pull guys into seeing it because she is aging great If you put a picture of Maggie up and I didnt know who it was I would guess 4246 range in age not 37 Guys are attracted to younger looking women it isnt Hollywood that started that It has always been this way
2015-05-21 11:43:09,2,0,2,Maggie,TIL Maggie Gyllenhaal is younger than I thought she was
2015-05-21 11:43:54,31,0,31,Maggie,Yeah Maggie has looked like an old woman for awhile

2015-05-21 11:45:04,9,0,9,Maggie,Oh for fucks sake look at the roles he plays No one in his movies acts like hes some handsome dude who sweeps a woman off her feet Imagine if Danny DeVito complained about not being paired with Angelina Jolie in Mr And MrsSmith You would laugh I know its hyperbole but Maggie Gyllenhaal legit looks like a grandma
2015-05-21 11:50:35,0,0,0,Maggie,gt Maggie Gyllenhaal has talent and good acting chops
2015-05-21 11:52:15,1,0,1,Maggie,I dont think its her actual age its how she looks Sorry Maggie Youre just upset you dont  look younger than you are
2015-05-21 11:52:18,1,0,1,Maggie,So what If the role requires a young actress so be it Maggie should audition for age appropriate roles She doesnt look 20 and should stop trying
2015-05-21 11:53:10,1,0,1,Maggie,Bingo Maggie is beautiful in her own way Shes a 10 where I live A 6 in california Thats looks alone She looks older Genetics like many have said Personality She seems like someone I could have long conversations with is a good actress and seems to have a kind demeaner If the ten was stereotype dumb spoiled cali girl Maggie wins hands down
2015-05-21 11:56:46,1,0,1,Maggie,Ive never understood how Maggie got cast for anything I cant stand her face
2015-05-21 11:58:16,1,0,1,Maggie,I would agree Theres the page header the headline h1 the picture text the wording changing slightly  but including key words like Maggie Gyllenhaal and too old  sprinkled with Hollywood Oscars actor and role
2015-05-21 11:59:06,2,0,2,Maggie,Exactly There are hot 37 year old women Its a bit rare but they are out there Actresses in Hollywood are expected to be hot for many roles Even women prefer watching physically attractive women on screen So thats why Maggie was marginal even when she was young Nowforget it She has to get unattractive older women roles now I like her as an actress but it would be silly to cast her as an attractive woman
2015-05-21 11:59:43,7,0,7,Maggie,Huh Ive been duped Youre right about him looking older but I think its more the cheeks than the eyes Still the picture of Maggie Gyllenhaal are WITH makeup and she looks old while this picture looks like a plain one of Clooney
2015-05-21 12:00:01,1,0,1,Maggie,Lets face it Maggie G is no Monica B  The latter will never be too old for anyone
2015-05-21 12:00:45,1,0,1,Maggie,So instead of telling her she wasnt attractive enough for the roll they spared her feelings and told her she was too old  Maggie Gyllenhaal is no Katie Holmes
2015-05-21 12:02:30,9,0,9,Maggie,Well a woman not finding Clooney or Pitt attractive is just as much of an outlier as a man finding Maggie Gyllenhaal attractive Hollywood is about mass appeal
2015-05-21 12:03:28,1,0,1,Maggie,A better idea for an article  Maggie Gyllenhaal Biggest Butterface Dealbreaker in Hollywood
2015-05-21 12:05:16,2,0,2,Maggie,Monica looks better at 50 than Maggie did when she was 27  At least in my opinion
2015-05-21 12:08:37,3,0,3,Maggie,Yeah this really isnt a sexism issue Its an issue of we need a 20 year old to play a role and Maggie doesnt look 20 or 37 or even 40 Id say 4243 at least although I love her acting and found her amazing in that Will Ferrell movie
2015-05-21 12:08:51,16,0,16,Maggie,I know multiple women in their 40s who look younger than Maggie Youth is beauty beauty youth She hasnt aged well and no amount of neckbeard shaming will change that fact Its not nice to be mean but she asked for it Men in their 50s are somehow still attractive to women in their 20s its just human nature Call it compensation for women in their early 20s having all the options for partners while men in their early 20s had to be top 10 to have half as many options
2015-05-21 12:10:22,9,0,9,Maggie,Everyone believes Maggies account of her experiences but doesnt want to believe an anonymous comment on the internet Whod have thunk it
2015-05-21 12:10:42,0,0,0,Maggie,jeeez maggie gyllenhaal looks rough
2015-05-21 12:11:53,4,0,4,Maggie,God give me a fucking break People thinking Maggie Gyllenhaal is unnatractive isnt mysoginy Women are just as likely to want attractive men in movies as men are to want attractive women Women typically like the well aged older men of Hollywood and men like the hot young chicks This is such a dumb thing to be up in arms about I want some average looking younger dude to start bitching about how he cant seem to land the wealthy older man role in romantic comedies Boo hoo  mysandry is so rampant on Reddit  I cant go anywhere without being told I wear funny hats and have a neckbeard  fuck off
2015-05-21 12:12:01,-1,0,-1,Maggie,And by unfair representation on women on the screen Maggie means she tried to unfairly block younger women more fitted to the role from getting it
2015-05-21 12:12:01,1,0,1,Maggie,Maggie is ugly but that has nothing to do with her acting ability or Hollywoods standards that continually put young women opposite old men I dont know anything about this movie or if the storyline had anything to do with their choice like if they were looking for a bombshell but it sucks that a 37yearold who can play someone her fucking age is passed BECAUSE of her age
2015-05-21 12:12:03,3,0,3,Maggie,Even when he first came on the scene he was fugly Like Maggie he had captive eyes and an ok body The rest was just too much of a disconnect from what Hollywood usually pumps out
2015-05-21 12:15:03,-6,0,-6,Maggie,Heres one from 2013httpwwwhawtcelebscomwpcontentuploads201212MAGGIEGYLLEHAALinWomanHomeMagazineJanuary2013Issue2jpg Shes always been cute and is moving through her 30s well thank you very much
2015-05-21 12:17:06,1,0,1,Maggie,It so happens I was just outside I was hitting on a waitress I thought was early 20s Turns out she was 38 She looks way better than Maggie You need to go outside more or at least go to more attractive cities
2015-05-21 12:17:07,1,0,1,Maggie,Wasnt meant to be im just geniunly curious to see what you consider attractive Because to me Maggie is a solid 7
2015-05-21 12:17:14,25,0,25,Maggie,Yeah shes like a less attractive Maggie Gyllenhaall
2015-05-21 12:17:25,1,0,1,Maggie,If it wasnt for Maggies father being in the industry she would never have been able to make it in the first place That goes for jake as well
2015-05-21 12:19:10,0,0,0,Maggie,Hollywood as a genre relies on really good looking lead roles almost exclusively I am willing to bet the 55 yo male is a really good looking 55 yo like Daniel Craig 48 or George Clooney 54 its hardly going to be Danny Devito The sad truth is Maggie Gyllenhaal hasnt aged well her face is showing ageing beyond her years and Hollywood doesnt it want it Its not sexism or ageism just Hollywoods fickle pursuit of beauty
2015-05-21 12:21:07,2,0,2,Maggie,Schwarzeneggershttplebeauleblogcom20121202whatthehellhappenedtoarnoldschwarzenegger career is in trouble but his performance in Maggie is one of the best hes ever given  Im really looking forward to seeing what he does outside of Terminator and Conan
2015-05-21 12:21:12,8,0,8,Maggie,I would rather have sex with Jake than Maggie she ugly
2015-05-21 12:21:55,1,0,1,Maggie,Maggie was told she was too old In an interview she expressed how she was told she was too old Quote I was told I was too old
2015-05-21 12:22:28,3,0,3,Maggie,So mean but I laughed because you are not wrong httpidailymailcoukipix201505201628E2AA3E000005783088871On_the_stage_Maggie_took_to_the_stage_during_the_event_at_The_Bea3_1432137558023jpg
2015-05-21 12:25:03,-1,0,-1,Maggie,Comments in this thread Maggie Gyllenhaal wasnt turned down because she was old but because shes not hot Somehow that makes it better or ok Seriously people
2015-05-21 12:28:26,2,0,2,Maggie,I dont know what it is but I like Maggie Gyllenhaal I was shocked to find out people thought she was bad in the Nolan trilogy I thought she struck a balance of looking good while still looking like the down to earth childhood friend that didnt accidentally become a supermodel which I think was the intent Shes pretty but doesnt look like a porn star
2015-05-21 12:31:35,9,0,9,Maggie,Theres the problem youre blind  Maggie Gyllenhall looks like another post put it a painting that was left out in the rain
2015-05-21 12:32:04,4,0,4,Maggie,Some men are Just like some women are still in there For every Tom Cruise we have a Val Kilmer For every Maggie Gyllenhaal we have a Sigourney Weaver
2015-05-21 12:32:28,2,0,2,Maggie,As a late 20s male Id much rather have Monica Belluci play my love interest than Maggie Gyllenhaal
2015-05-21 12:32:39,3,0,3,Maggie,All my friends and I have always jokes about how old and ugly she was in Dark Knight  We have grown up in the Batman movies and have seen Kim Basinger Drew Barrymore Uma Thurman Nicole Kidman Michelle Pfeiffer and more recently Anne Hathaway  We always joke that Maggie is the biggest casting mistake and shouldve played the butlers love interest instead  So there is reality in what the producers told her
2015-05-21 12:36:59,2,0,2,Maggie,In Hollywoods defense Maggie Sad Turtle Gyllenhaal looked 37 when she was 20
2015-05-21 12:38:40,19,0,19,Maggie,She looks beat MaryLouise Parker is 50 and she looks years younger than Maggie
2015-05-21 12:38:55,8,0,8,Maggie,And the general audience doesnt care about fair representation either they prefer watching hot women in their early 20s getting naked on screen not Maggie Gyellenhall
2015-05-21 12:40:35,-7,0,-7,Maggie,A handsome rich billionaire super hero living in New York Gotham that almost exclusively dates supermodels going for a girl like Maggie Gyllenhall was just not a plausible scenario for me
2015-05-21 12:43:15,3,0,3,Maggie,Coming soon  Maggie Gyllenhaal as James Bond
2015-05-21 12:44:14,0,0,0,Maggie,Eh Maggie is definitely hit or miss I suppose but she is very attractive at times and the people that call her ugly are ridiculous
2015-05-21 12:44:15,2,0,2,Maggie,Came here to say this Maggie is just homely
2015-05-21 12:45:26,2,0,2,Maggie,My mom is 57 and looks only a few years older than her Maggie got some bum genes
2015-05-21 12:46:54,32,0,32,Maggie,When I saw Batman Begins and then saw the Dark Knight I for sure thought that Katie had some kind of a stroke and reappeared for this movie looking like shit Then I realized it was Maggie Gyllenhall
2015-05-21 12:48:25,8,0,8,Maggie,Im a semiemployed university student and I regularly see and have friends that are far far more attractive than Maggie Gyllenhall
2015-05-21 12:48:41,1,0,1,Maggie,Maggie Gyllenhaal has never done it for me
2015-05-21 12:49:04,0,0,0,Maggie,Hollywood is a shallow business Who knew  I like Maggie and think shes very attractive even beautiful in her own peculiar way There is sooo much trash talk out there about her
2015-05-21 12:49:19,-1,0,-1,Maggie,Maggie hit the wall hard
2015-05-21 12:51:43,2,0,2,Maggie,i cant remember hearing any protest when a younger Maggie Gyllenhaal was preferred over her older peers
2015-05-21 12:52:26,11,0,11,Maggie,With all due respect to Maggie and her work she certainly does not look 37 I think thats the issue is not that shes 37 the problem is that she looks a lot older  and of course these producers and casting agents dont want to tell her that She looks more like 4550 Maybe its hair her style her cheekbones i dont know but she looks 10 years older Nevertheless show business can be cruel to the aging but Im sure they all knew what they were getting into
2015-05-21 12:54:53,3,0,3,Maggie,You are right that Maggie Gyllenhaal is no Katie Holmes  Gyllenhaal can act has presence and oozes charisma
2015-05-21 12:57:59,1,0,1,Maggie,Omg this is so comical No Maggie it is not your age It is because you look like a mashed potato at the age of 37
2015-05-21 12:59:09,-7,0,-7,Maggie,As opposed to everyone taking MaggieGs word for it that this really happened despite her offering no corroborating details like the project or the producer
2015-05-21 13:01:55,3,0,3,Maggie,To be fair if we are going by the pics provided in that specific article Monica Bellucci looks WAY better at 50 than Maggie Gyllenhaal does at 37
2015-05-21 13:02:37,2,0,2,Maggie,Honestly the ACLU needs to fuck off some timesthis is one of them Also Maggie isnt hot Theyd be better off getting a MILF 10 years her senior Simply having a vagina doesnt make her a prime candidate for such a role
2015-05-21 13:02:39,2,0,2,Maggie,To be fair if we are going by the pics provided in that specific article Monica Bellucci looks WAY better at 50 than Maggie Gyllenhaal does at 37

2015-05-21 13:03:02,1,0,1,Maggie,To be fair if we are going by pics in general Maggie Gyllenhaal has never looked good
2015-05-21 13:03:06,1,0,1,Maggie,To be fair if we are going by the pics provided in that specific article Monica Bellucci looks WAY better at 50 than Maggie Gyllenhaal does at 37

2015-05-21 13:04:11,1,0,1,Maggie,Even if that is the reason this doesnt need any defending Maggie has not aged well She is 37 but looks 45 from the included articles picture
2015-05-21 13:05:03,4,0,4,Maggie,Dear Maggie they really mean you are not good looking enough to be with George Clooney  And they are right
2015-05-21 13:05:27,1,0,1,Maggie,Did they seriously want the viewer to believe Billionare Bruce Wayne who could date anyone in the world would be interested in someone who looks like Maggie Gyllenhaal  Seriously I get the whole childhood friend thing but if you can literally get any woman in the world and your childhood friend grows up to look like Susan Boyle I dont see it happening
2015-05-21 13:05:41,1,0,1,Maggie,As shallow as it is I dont think it was her age I think it has more to do with her appearance Jennifer Aniston still appears in heaps of movies and shes 46 The difference is that she looks great for her age and shes a very attractive woman Im not saying Maggie Gyllenhall is unattractive but in the entertainment industry she doesnt really fit the ideals of beauty that theyre probably looking for
2015-05-21 13:11:00,-3,0,-3,Maggie,Because the obvious realistic scenario is that Maggie Gyllanhaal a 37 year old career professional actor is upset because she was turned down to play a 15 year old not the LONG DOCUMENTED HISTORY of bias against female actors over 35
2015-05-21 13:11:06,0,0,0,Maggie,I see a great big whoosh over Maggies head orbiting fusing with elementary particles creating a big black hole of pure willfully oblivious mass
2015-05-21 13:17:12,2,0,2,Maggie,I dont get where youre going with this Does one womans achievements downplay the issue Maggie is dealing with
2015-05-21 13:22:41,-3,0,-3,Maggie,Agreed but why trust Maggie on this  Not like she proved specifics or evidence  Its just a claim vs another claim nothing more
2015-05-21 13:23:27,6,0,6,Maggie,Yes weve all been there when we were 1825 See all those beautiful people sitting beside you in class take another look at them in 15 years and let me know how many look as good as Maggie Gyllenhall does
2015-05-21 13:23:48,4,0,4,Maggie,So you pretty much just randomly picked a comment to complain about sexism Because the whole chain of comments was in relation to how someone posted a comment to the article stating that the character she was auditioning for was in her early 20s Or at least thats the characters age in the book But the problem was Maggie nor the random commenter mentioned the name of book or movie so there was no way of knowing for certain why Maggie was turned down
2015-05-21 13:25:14,-2,0,-2,Maggie,The issue Maggie is dealing with is not sexism in the industry it is denial She refuses to accept that she is no longer capable of fitting into the roles that she wants to adopt
2015-05-21 13:29:15,1,0,1,Maggie,Maggies comments arent verified either to be fair
2015-05-21 13:42:24,0,0,0,Maggie,I think its pretty obvious that women just arent very good at anything INCLUDING TELLING THE TRUTH MAGGIE GYLLENHALand the statistics you quoted proved it
2015-05-21 13:45:39,-2,0,-2,Maggie,So what youre saying is that Maggie Gyllenhaal doesnt look young enough to play a 55 year olds girlfriend
2015-05-21 13:51:04,2,0,2,Maggie,Mad Max Fury Road amp Maggie Or Mad Maggie Spoiler Max just shoots Maggie
2015-05-21 14:14:10,1,0,1,Maggie,No its because Maggie provides no specifics only a vague claim  Why believe her  I dont believe the commenter either neither provide evidence  Critical thinking use it
2015-05-21 14:20:38,-1,0,-1,Maggie,So youre saying in all seriousness that if you saw Maggie Gyllenhaal a 37 year old woman going out with a 55 year old man you would say thats so weird shes way too old for him
2015-05-21 14:22:11,2,0,2,Maggie,The line of comments I replied to were quotes from the movie Donnie Darko starring Jake and Maggie Gyllenhaal
2015-05-21 14:27:52,-1,0,-1,Maggie,that is just a nice way of saying that she is too ugly  Nobody runs over to see a nude Maggie Gyllenhal picture  She should just get fat and then she can join the ham movement and make herself feel better when she complains on the internet
2015-05-21 14:31:54,2,0,2,Maggie,they probably wanted someone attractive maggie gyllenhaal looks like an old shoe
2015-05-21 14:33:25,2,0,2,Maggie,So at 37 Maggie Gyllenhaal was trying out for the role of a 22 year old women Yeah she should laugh
2015-05-21 14:36:50,1,0,1,Maggie,Or they just told her she was too old because they didnt want to come out and say you didnt get the role because youre Maggie Gyllenhaal
2015-05-21 14:50:30,4,0,4,Maggie,No Maggie you cant play opposite Jeremy Irons in Lolita
2015-05-21 14:50:53,3,0,3,Maggie,You said all of that to give your subjective opinion on Maggie Gyllenhaal attractiveness I never mentioned her being attractive All this stuff about Jack Black not auditioning for Superman is unnecessary as well
2015-05-21 14:55:23,2,0,2,Maggie,Well Lorde is like 17 and looks too old to play a high school or college kid Sometimes you dont look the right age for the part Maggie Gyllenhaal is a great actress and doesnt need to jump on the waah Im a victim train
2015-05-21 14:58:19,2,0,2,Maggie,I got a laugh out of my friends comment on the character change between the two movies imagine going to bed with Katie Holmes but waking up next to Maggie Gyllenhal Most men would stop drinking
2015-05-21 14:58:49,1,0,1,Maggie,Uh elephant in the room  Maggie is kinda ugly  Even when she was 20
2015-05-21 15:00:04,1,0,1,Maggie,Also worthy of noting is that Maggie appears a bit older than her age
2015-05-21 15:00:07,1,0,1,Maggie,Also worthy of noting is that Maggie appears a bit older than her age
2015-05-21 15:03:26,1,0,1,Maggie,Also Maggie Gyllenhaal isnt really that great of an Actor
2015-05-21 15:05:47,0,0,0,Maggie,Damn yeah she was And Maggie aint ugly but she also isnt nearly as attractive as a lot of leading ladies with 10 years on her That picture especially I would have guessed she was in her 40s On top of that I feel like there isnt a lot of leeway for average looking leads in dramas
2015-05-21 15:06:40,2,0,2,Maggie,Correct Thats the issue The producer was trying to be nice Salma Hayek or Sofia Vergara are both older but they could play the love interest of any male role from 12120 Maggie is just not a good looking girl
2015-05-21 15:06:59,6,0,6,Maggie,Maggie claimed she was TOLD that it was because she was too old at 37 to play the love interest of a 55yearold man So if that information is true it absolutely DOES follow Not necessarily there may be missing information but to claim it doesnt follow is absurd
2015-05-21 15:07:42,1,0,1,Maggie,I dont understand why this is even news They want a specific person for the role and Maggie doesnt fit it The end
2015-05-21 15:08:13,2,0,2,Maggie,It seems like Maggie still feels shes young and relevant and when she got turned down for the role of a younger woman because of her age she took it as a personal attack on her and women as a whole
2015-05-21 15:08:19,4,0,4,Maggie,When I watched Dark Knight with my girlfriend at the time she asked how did Katie Holmes turn so ugly not realizing it was Maggie Gyllenhall playing the role in the second movie
2015-05-21 15:10:45,4,0,4,Maggie,How the fuck is it unfair Whats unfar is that you are labeling me and others as somehow mysogynistic for not finding Maggie Gyllenhaal attractive I prefer younger women Always have Always will Most guys do What about women liking older men Am I entitled to descrimination compensation for all those years that I wasnt getting laid because of George Clooney It isnt unfair that women in Hollywood are expected to be attractive
2015-05-21 15:11:07,0,0,0,Maggie,gt Also disappointing that Maggie would get angry because she cant pass as someone in her 20s
2015-05-21 15:11:54,2,0,2,Maggie,To be fair Maggies sad turtle face was too old for a lot of roles by the time she was 18
2015-05-21 15:12:29,2,0,2,Maggie,Well Maggie with your droopy face and those cheeks youve always looked older than your age
2015-05-21 15:13:13,0,0,0,Maggie,Because thats the point Youre not old Maggie you just look old and you were applying for a role of a 20 year old She needs to get over herself not blame the industry
2015-05-21 15:13:13,2,0,2,Maggie,I know Ill get downvoted but no maggie its because you are butt fucking ugly
2015-05-21 15:13:19,2,0,2,Maggie,Just read the headline and thought well that IS pretty old Maggie
2015-05-21 15:15:03,2,0,2,Maggie,Jesus Christ a girl in a bond movie is essentially there to be a pretty face for Bond to seduce  I love Flemmings stories but lets not kid ourselves here people  Bond is a MCP  Maggie needs a little dose of reality check and a little less entitlement
2015-05-21 15:17:13,1,0,1,Maggie,I just dont believe that Christian Bale and Aaron Eckhert would be fighting over Maggie Gyllenhal
2015-05-21 15:18:59,3,0,3,Maggie,gt  Also disappointing that Maggie would get angry because she cant pass as someone in her 20s
2015-05-21 15:20:31,0,0,0,Maggie,The sad reality is that the producers and directors can hire whomever they want  Im not saying that it is less fucked up but seriously hasnt she already made it  Shell just go down the block to the next set and get a different role that pays her millions for a few months of work  Perhaps a young unestablished and ambitious actor got the part Maggie wanted
2015-05-21 15:21:04,1,0,1,Maggie,Maybe it was their way of saying Maggie you are ugly and were never actually hott and please get s new nose because that thing has been pissing me off for 15 years Its just odd
2015-05-21 15:22:52,1,0,1,Maggie,I dont like Maggie Gyllenhaal or her impressive jowls nor do I find her particularly talented That being said even if she does look considerably older than she actually is why is it so awful for a 55 year old man to play opposite a 55 year old woman or god forbid an older woman If they turned her down for looking like Richard Nixon in drag thats one thing but too old for a man that age is just absurd
2015-05-21 15:23:16,1,0,1,Maggie,maggie gyllenhaal has always looked like an old lady
2015-05-21 15:24:56,1,0,1,Maggie,Some 22 year old actress should come out with an article saying she was not connected enough for the roles Maggie got
2015-05-21 15:25:31,1,0,1,Maggie,Remember in The Dark Knight when they tried to convince us that Maggie Gylenhall used to be Katie Holmeswas hot enough for billionaire playboy Christian Bale I wasnt convinced then either
2015-05-21 15:26:49,2,0,2,Maggie,Ive always found Maggie Gyllenhaal to look 15 years older than her age Its something subtle in her face shes been giving off a librarian vibe for some time
2015-05-21 15:26:55,1,0,1,Maggie,Nowhere is it mentioned that billionaire playboys have to be with bombshells Its called love Theres not a baseline limit of physical beauty attached to someone falling in love with you And theoretically if there were Maggie Gyllenhaal far exceeds that baseline
2015-05-21 15:28:42,2,0,2,Maggie,Because its Maggie Gyllenhall shes not sexy
2015-05-21 15:29:19,1,0,1,Maggie,True I never understand the hate for Maggie over Katie Katie is just as ugly
2015-05-21 15:30:40,1,0,1,Maggie,No offense to Maggie but she looks a bit more mature as compared to other actresses its genetics and botox When she played a role in batman she seemed much older than Christian Bale It not really about age in Hollywood but more so how you can appeal to a larger audience just look at Angelina Jolie Megan Gale and Charlize Theron Its more so how famous you are and your ability to play the role than age
2015-05-21 15:36:25,0,0,0,Maggie,Also see Toy Story 2 for a real example of how dynamic and talented Joan is VO is much more difficult IMO than on screen acting You have to express the entire package with your voice only Imagine Maggie as Jessie That would have been so forgetful
2015-05-21 15:40:11,3,0,3,Maggie,Hes getting downvoted because roughly half of people think hes absolutely wrong Maggie Gyllenhaal has a very unique and divisive look some people think shes oneinamillion and cute as a button some people think shes a melting basset hound
2015-05-21 15:45:08,0,0,0,Maggie,Try working in IT Maggie
2015-05-21 15:48:54,2,0,2,Maggie,Maggie Gyllenhaal recently visited a wise old Asian psychologist somewhat famous in celebrity circles in Hollywood Dr Zao  As she entered his office he told her in a soft toneLie down young man and tell me what is twoubling you  Maggie said Im a WOMYN how dare you  After reassuring her that his eye sight had remained in his better years Dr Zao instructed her to relax and speak openly
2015-05-21 15:55:30,2,0,2,Maggie,Seriously People would have you think theyre supermodels themselves with the way these comments sound Maggie is a woman of average attractiveness and probably above average considering shes in better shape than at least 90 of Americans one could easily say shes above average in attractiveness
2015-05-21 16:00:20,3,0,3,Maggie,Inuniverse she dated Bruce in their youth Presumably high school because they werent even an item when he comes back to visit in Batman Begins Shes dating Dent in The Dark Knight Furthermore is it really that hard to believe that SOME people find her attractive Shes definitely more attractive than the average American just due to the fact that shes in shape Then consider that shes dressed up and its not inconceivable that someone would find her to be beautiful Just because you think Maggie  ugly doesnt mean everyone else would inuniverse or in real life
2015-05-21 16:02:57,1,0,1,Maggie,Why is it not possible for him to be in love with her for reasons other than looks Even with Katie Holmes playing Rachel whos prettier than Maggie Bruce runs around with Russian ballerinas much hotter than her If he only wanted looks he could literally have it every night with multiple women You dont have to believe shes a bombshell to believe hes in love with her Katie is cute but shes no bombshell
2015-05-21 16:20:16,3,0,3,Maggie,are you serious brad pitt looks much much younger than 51 young women in their 20s by and large still go apeshit over him and find him extremely attractive Maggie gyllenhal looks at least a decade older than she is I dont know anyone who really finds her very attractive I did think she was cute in Donnie darko when she was younger I remember seeing the dark knight for the first time and thinking damn she looks so old and looking up her age just to check Comparing the two and essentially saying See people judge women for having a few wrinkles but nobody cares about what men look like makes no sense whatsoever everyone is different the article gave monica bellucci as an example she looks amazing for 50 and would make sense on screen with someone like brad pitt Elizabeth hurley looks incredible at 49 Jennifer aniston at 46 I could go on and on Every person ages differently and it is no big revelation that looks play a part in Hollywood
2015-05-21 16:37:39,-1,0,-1,Maggie,Actors both men and women have to be attractive Im pretty sure that Im not attractive enough to get the roles that an attractive man would get Of course not every role requires the actor to be attractive in fact there are roles that require an actor to be ugly Steve Buscemi gets all those roles Unattractive women can similarly get roles as the friend of the leading actress Someone like Maggie Gyllenhaal should be trying for those roles
2015-05-21 16:38:00,0,0,0,Maggie,Are you saying Maggies face is asymmetrical Shannen Dohertys eyes are uneven yet she was pretty hot in the 90s
2015-05-21 16:42:26,1,0,1,Maggie,The average person is less attractive than Maggie Gyllenhall Now this is partly due to the fact that shes in better shape than the average American but it still stands By real life standards Id say Maggie is something like a 7 if were doing a scale of 10 A 7 is a girl who doesnt necessarily immediately catch your eye but isnt really ugly
2015-05-21 16:46:47,2,0,2,Maggie,I think you mixed up Maggie with one of the great female actors of our time
2015-05-21 16:58:01,1,0,1,Maggie,Yes a 7 I think you underestimate how the average person especially in their late30s looks Or you frequent the most attractive WalMarts in America I live in Miami where there are tons of attractive to model hot people all over and I dont think Maggie is nearly as bad as reddit makes her out to be
2015-05-21 17:04:23,1,0,1,Maggie,No I am not saying that I think Maggie is attractive actually I am saying that the people who buy movie tickets dictate what movie formulas will be If people buying tickets would buy them for movies with women that are in their 50s as the love interestsex symbol then Hollywood would make those movies It comes back to the same thing I say about people complaining about remakesreboots of old TV movies and shows Hollywood will make whatever sells thats what they are in business for If people buy tickets for original films and not remakes then Hollywood will create original films and not remakes In this case for almost a century movie fans have expressed an overwhelming desire to want young attractive females as their main females in a movie by buying way more tickets for those movies than ones that have older female leads So all of the people who are outraged that she looked too old for the part need only start buying tickets for movies that have older female leads
2015-05-21 17:38:34,1,0,1,Maggie,You didnt answer my question about the symmetry of maggies face So let me answer that for you as someone whos been photographing portraits for many years Her face is not asymmetrical Her cheeks and nose make an odd combination but she is by no means ugly Then lets move on to comparing her and Katie Holmes Aside from the initial impression of their looks Maggies acting is much more charismatic and confident compare to Katies and thats coming from someone who had a teenage crush on Katie Holmes
2015-05-21 18:41:13,-1,0,-1,Maggie,Ten years ago Maxim mag ranked Maggie Gyllenhaal among the Top 25 Sexiest Women in the World  I told you Jews control the media
2015-05-21 19:58:38,2,0,2,Maggie,I think Maggie lied about her age and that this tool destroyed her lie for what it was
2015-05-21 21:42:04,-2,0,-2,Maggie,Could someone let Maggie know Id still hit it please
2015-05-21 22:00:58,2,0,2,Maggie,Maggie never mentioned the age of the character We believe her perception of her experience but it doesnt mean her perception lines up with reality
2015-05-21 22:07:25,3,0,3,Maggie,which is roughly equivalent to the level of confidence you can have in the contents of the article as well which also made baseless claims without evidence or context Thats the entire point The only real difference between Maggie and Anonymous Commenter is that one of them is famous They are both people making baseless claims
2015-05-21 22:09:00,0,0,0,Maggie,The entire point of discrediting Maggie G based on the random comments of a random Internet user was to show that Maggie Gyllanhall might be lying too
2015-05-21 22:21:26,0,0,0,Maggie,Do you honestly think Maggie Gyllenhall would make this remark if the role was for something like that random Internet commenter probably made up
2015-05-21 22:49:22,-1,0,-1,Maggie,This is not unfalsifiable People who are somewhat close to her could certainly know that it isnt true You or I cant sure But if I had to rate who had more to lose from lying in this situation Maggie would rate higher than Anonymous internet person
2015-05-21 23:45:45,0,0,0,Maggie,Its clear that Maggie has much more claim to the truth about something that happened to her than some anonymous Internet commenter we have no reason to believe was involved at all You shouldnt be equally skeptical of their claims If youre skeptical of her go for it but its much more reasonable to be more skeptical of someone you know literally nothing about
2015-05-22 00:46:28,2,0,2,Maggie,gt Its clear that Maggie has much more claim to the truth about something that happened to her
2015-05-22 01:47:22,-5,0,-5,Maggie,Silly duck she cant be 40 Maggie G says women over 37 dont get work in Hollywood
2015-05-22 02:10:49,9,0,9,Maggie,She didnt say that I believe she said that she was told that 37 is too old to play opposite a 55 year old male Unfortunately Im pretty sure Hollywood usually follows that message However Maggie is not a good lookin lady and was probably told that instead of you are too ugly to get the role I mean people want to look at nice looking men and women in their films For example Sofia Verga is not only over 37 but also plays opposite a 55 year old man and she is the highest paid actress on TV So not always true
2015-05-22 09:42:24,77,0,77,Maggie,Its from a show based on the antics of Bart Simpson Lisa Simpson Maggie Simpson Marge Simpson and Homer Simpson I think it was called _The Springfield Family_ Its like that film The Simpsons Movie but in hundreds of 20minute episodes instead of one 90 minute movie
2015-05-22 10:03:26,5,0,5,Maggie,I think its an issue regardless It says a lot about the state of Hollywood when its basically a norm for the 50 male to date a 20something female rather than someone around their own age range Thus male actors can find good work well into their golden years while talented female actors such as Maggie Gyllenhaal cant play the love interest of a male much older than them since theyre too old
2015-05-22 10:56:02,1,0,1,Maggie,I 100 agree that there is an issue with Hollywood films depicting romantic relationships with a younger woman and an older man and this has implications for female actors as they get older but that can be dealt with as in independent issue My issue is that there is a huge focus on Maggie Gyllenhaal being too old to be the love interest of a 55 year old like the focus is on the 55 year old male theres nothing disclosed about what age the writers etc want the female role to be if that makes sense I feel like it would be a bigger issue if the role was a 40ish year old woman and Maggie got rejected for being too old but if the part is for a 20ish year old character then she obviously cant play it because she doesnt look that age And that is why I want sources from those who say that the character is meant to be 20ish otherwise this whole argument is something entirely different

2015-05-23 02:45:05,2,0,2,Maggie,To your left we can see a bitter and lonely internet dweller who insults women far above his capacity because he spends all of his life in his mind where fantasies grant him access to the sexiest women on earth thus causing him to forget how truly lucky hed be to so much as hold Maggie Gyllenhalls hand Observe as he responds to my commentary with hissing denial spitting and declarations of superiority Moving on to the radiation poisoning victims
2015-05-23 06:43:07,0,0,0,Maggie,haha yeah very true  My point is that perhaps she isnt turned down because her age and there are other reasons behind her rejection  Maggie G doesnt sell tickets whatsoever
2015-05-23 14:44:06,1,0,1,Maggie,So the average American isnt middle class and overweight If WalMart isnt a good example think of your local DMV The point is Maggie is at least as atttactive as the average woman her age and has been her whole career Id lean towards saying shes slightly above the average And like I said in another comment I live in Miami a region filled with more attractive people than most of America

2015-05-25 09:57:22,2,0,2,Maggie,I got excited for Frank when Fassbender went on Colbert to promote it and the the cast preformed a song from the movie Fassbender who is generally pretty great seemed so excited about the movie and looked like he was having a ball preforming live with the Frank head on I was not let down Great fun and fucking sad movie Maggie Gyllenhaal is so damn funny in the movie and both Scoot McNairy and Domhnall Gleeson have great chemistry with everyone

2015-05-25 19:42:22,-1,0,-1,Maggie,Noooo Arnold needs to do serious roles and stop rehashing old franchises The dudes old but he can be a kickass grandpa like in Maggie
2015-05-25 20:50:33,19,0,19,Maggie,He can also apparently act now from what Ive heard about Maggie
2015-05-25 22:52:24,21,0,21,Maggie,True lies and Last Action Hero were carried by his comedic timing and Kindergarten Cop was sorta 50 hardass 50 comedic timing and T2 while brilliant the whole point of his performance in that was to be wooden and unemotive Ive been hearing really good things about Maggie though when it comes to his actual acting range
2015-05-27 08:05:42,1,0,1,Maggie,Funny that the argument against Gyllenhaal is that we dont know anything about the movie so she was probably just wrong for the part when that also means you have to make huge strides in assumptions on the film to reach that conclusion Like who the target audience is that its an action movie that its about  that the dude is a hunky sixpack sporting 55 year old that this situation is the equivalent of a fat 40 year old male auditioning for the male lead in a softcore porno made for women All we know is this womanhttpwwwprotothemagrfiles120150521687c6e990515da75a50df237e496614djpg was too ugly for the love interest of a 55 year old man which is pure unadulterated sexism You would NEVER see something about an oscar nominated male that is at the equivalent level of attractiveness as Maggie turned down as the love interest of a nearly 60 year old woman because they are too old
2015-05-27 21:34:48,1,0,1,Maggie,I think Maggie might be disappointing  I hope it wont but Ive heard so many bad reviews  Which sucks because even if it didnt have Arnold I still find it to be an amazing concept

2015-05-01 11:31:52,1,0,1,Noble,Remember that the entire fight they are trying to convert Luke to the Dark Side If you watch the end of fight closely you can see Vader is backing up allowing Luke to believe he has the upper hand He falls down completely of his own volition He allows Luke to cut off his mechanical hand Sideous knows that if Luke kills Vader he can convert him to the Dark Side Vader is dying he is broken Sideouss plan is to have Luke kill Vader and ultimately turn to the Dark Side and be a student of Sideousremember the Rule of Two The Light in Vader that Luke sees is his love of Luke Luke dying was never the plan In Vader mind he is sacrificing himself for Luke a noble act But when Sideous says Now you will die It is no longer a sacrifice and he has to make a choice Does he let Luke die and go try to convert Leia or kill Sideous save Luke and return balence to the force Id say the choice is obvious but he has to think about it The whole trilogy is Darth Sideous trying to convert Luke or Leia to the Dark Side
2015-05-01 13:20:57,7,0,7,Noble,I came here to make this point The film was okay the graphics werent so great but they did their job However how can a guy who in one part of the movie sees a bullet travel in front of him somehow then die from being shot multiple times They sacrificed key plot points to give him a noble death

2015-05-04 22:41:24,1,0,1,Noble,I think you might be projecting what youd like to see happen in a future MCU movie when theres not really any evidence for it The whole thing with Cap slightly moving the hammer was just a gag and it worked well It suggests that hes noble and speaks to his character but thats kind of where it starts and ends It doesnt have anything to do with his dark side and I dont think its very likely well see Cap wield the hammer in the films I dont see that theres any reason to think that we would

2015-05-07 14:39:04,-1,0,-1,Noble,I like the movie but the racial allegory was heavyhanded It sort of collapses too if you apply any thought to it Equating coloredness with political social and artistic progressivism is exocitization and hems close to the noble savage trope The color in the movie is associated with freeing ones mind from the strict limitations set on it by 50s consumer culture But racism isnt about a group of people being marginalized for their creativity intellect or broad minds its about a group of people being marginalized because of where their parents came from what they look like I thought the equivocation was thematically sloppy

2015-05-23 14:32:19,8,0,8,Noble,Last Christmas I went to buy a book for my BIL at Barnes amp Nobles The book had no price on it and when I went to pay it turns out the price wasnt the same as the online price which was for the online store Getting the book in store was a little more expensive than just ordering online and paying taxes and shipping It felt like I was being charged a convenience fee just for trying to shop in the store Swore big chain stores off after that Theyre putting themselves out of business
2015-05-23 16:32:48,2,0,2,Noble,It wasnt the fact that it was more expensive in the store that bothered me It was the fact that there was no price tag anywhere near the book to tell me how expensive it was and I had to find out at the register that bothered me Its compounded by the fact that I tried to figure out the cost of the book by going to the Barnes amp Noble website to find the price of the book and wasnt told anywhere that it was the price only if you bought the book online
2015-05-23 17:11:03,2,0,2,Noble,A noble spirit embiggens the smallest man
2015-05-23 18:16:03,3,0,3,Noble,Im 23 Ive known about him for years I read TJ Englishs book Paddy Whackedhttpwwwbarnesandnoblecomwpaddywhackedtjenglish1100717427ean9780060590031 years ago and Bulger is a big part of it
2015-05-23 19:01:42,15,0,15,Noble,Yeah French accents are notoriously hard for actors to drop when speaking English And Im not even sure its necessary for the character Does Shakespeare give us any background on Lady Macbeths upbringing If not its certainly not a stretch to imagine that a powerful Scottish nobleman would have a French wife though the historical person was indeed Scottish
2015-05-24 07:17:51,2,0,2,Noble,Scotland adopted English after the events of Macbeth although many of the nobles would have spoken it anyway
2015-05-24 16:41:01,1,0,1,Noble,I seem to remember reading that he based his performance for Kick Ass loosely on Adam Wests Batman Mainly the way he delivered his lines when he was Big Daddy Genius move since it just comes off as hammy and hilarious nowadays like some average Joe putting on a noble superhero persona when hes wearing the mask
2015-05-26 01:43:24,1,0,1,Noble,Is it obtuse to question or belittle those that question  You tell me which is more noble
2015-05-28 20:13:34,5,0,5,Noble,Look my main point is that this comparison has really been done too many times Besides Avatar is not a ripoff of Pocahontas Both of them use very old tropes  the noble savage who is in harmony with nature a character identifying with another civilization and joining it Pocahontas or FernGully or Dances with Wolves didnt make up those tropes theyre hundreds of years old
2015-05-30 22:35:07,1,0,1,Noble,Nosotros los nobles is awesome
2015-05-31 19:42:59,1,0,1,Noble,I didnt say the film was emotional I said it was emotionally dictative by which I meant it was like being at a fairground ride on rails where you are shown set pieces and when to feel disgust when to feel horror when to feel noble restraint etc

2015-05-19 11:51:56,2,0,2,Hot Pursuit,Ummm what are you talking about I dont know where you live but in my area adult dramas like Noble The Water Diviner Far from the Madding Crowd Woman in Gold and The Age of Adaline are all currently in wide release Then theres two stupid comedies hot pursuit Paul Blart one kids movie which are usually better than adult dramas anyway although Home which is currently in theaters probably is not whatever Pitch Perfect 2 is a postapocalyptic 80s action movie Mad Max and a superhero movie Avengers I know you were being hyperbolic about multiplexes being half superhero genre flicks but still we only have three or four a year is more emblematic of a modern trend than some sort of cultural genocide Treatment of females in movies overuse of digital instead of film stock and expensive 3D are more viral and more concerning trends in film
2015-05-20 14:12:24,3,0,3,Hot Pursuit,Cant remember last year but for 2015 the worst film is Hot Pursuit thus far And Ive seen Jupiter Ascending and 50 Shades as well

2015-05-10 01:16:07,2,0,2,Big Hero 6,Big Hero 6 was not solid It was enjoyable and funny but thats as far as it went I know Im just a random internet stranger but let me tell you Im a 21yearold guy who loves good animated films Just in general movies that I think are critically good are ones that I will and do watch again
2015-05-10 01:25:27,2,0,2,Big Hero 6,The academy for best animated movie is worth about as much as dirt when Big Hero 6 beats out Tale of Princess Kaguya
2015-05-10 02:23:56,1,0,1,Big Hero 6,I agree easily my 2nd favorite Pixar movie after big hero 6
2015-05-10 03:22:24,12,0,12,Big Hero 6,Its your favorite Pixar movie then Big Hero 6 was made by Walt Disney Animation Studios not Pixar
2015-05-10 03:41:23,1,0,1,Big Hero 6,Big Hero 6 was not solid It was soft and comfortable like a great big marshmallow
2015-05-10 04:19:02,2,0,2,Big Hero 6,Princess Kaguya losing to Big Hero 6 was just ridiculous
2015-05-10 04:48:27,17,0,17,Big Hero 6,That dinosaur one seems iffy It should of came out last year but was behind on animation or something and they had to push Big Hero 6 up cutting a lot of what was supposed to go in it to replace its spot  Then when it finally had a good cut it really put off test audiences mainly the kids didnt like it at all The Pixar movie that is coming out soonest doesnt seem like a major hit either
2015-05-10 06:26:25,161,0,161,Big Hero 6,Big Hero 6 is a colorful superhero movie
2015-05-10 06:37:19,1,0,1,Big Hero 6,Nope A increibles  big hero 6 crossover would be cool but they are still diffrent universes

2015-05-18 01:34:45,1,0,1,Big Hero 6,Well why not just say some of the Big Hero 6 A lot of them are only nicknamed
2015-05-18 07:00:24,1,0,1,Big Hero 6,Maybe because most of the people I asked were girls They were more interested in disney movies like Big Hero 6 or Frozen The two dudes thought the movie was good and said nothing beyond that
2015-05-18 11:50:35,-2,0,-2,Big Hero 6,I watched Big Hero 6 right before the Oscars because I knew I was already partial to HTTYD I was just floored at its mediocrity It was every super hero movie Ive ever seen just in animated form
2015-05-18 11:52:47,0,0,0,Big Hero 6,I thought HTTYD was far more mature than Big Hero 6 If the Lego movie didnt have a decent ending I wouldnt have been Impressed by it at all It was too spastic for me and Im actually glad it was snubbed

2015-05-18 20:38:40,1,0,1,Big Hero 6,Big hero 6 made me tear up twice such a great movie
2015-05-19 01:41:01,6,0,6,Big Hero 6,It also explains the countless people who think Big Hero 6 is a Pixar film
2015-05-20 21:04:37,5,0,5,Big Hero 6,Big Hero 6 and Interstellar I have no freakin idea but I know it would be hilarious xD
2015-05-21 04:35:38,2,0,2,Big Hero 6,That would explain why Big Hero 6 won It certainly was popular  nicely made but not in the same league as Song of the sea or Kaguya in my opinion
2015-05-22 23:46:31,1,0,1,Big Hero 6,I thoroughly enjoyed Birdman and thought it deserving of its win but theres one real point of contention I have here no way is How to Train Your Dragon 2 better than Big Hero 6 The big plot point at the center of the film is the reveal of a character of great importance to the main cast who upon meeting Hiccup and Stoick proceeds to do nothing of importance for the rest of the film
2015-05-24 06:09:20,4,0,4,Big Hero 6,Big Hero 6 has some glaring instances in it

2015-05-19 16:04:49,0,0,0,Fifty Shades of Grey,Calling Shame a good Fifty Shades of Grey movie is an understatement Those films have nothing in common except for sex In fact they are complete opposites obviously in quality filmmaking acting and pace but also in the general idea Sex in Fifty Shades is just a kinky adventurous fantasy not a serious addiction that destroys the characters life Shame has nothing to do with pleasure but rather depression If you expect a somewhaterotic romance movie that makes you feel all warm and fuzzy inside do not watch Shame
2015-05-19 18:02:07,2,0,2,Fifty Shades of Grey,I know Reddit isnt one person but its pretty funny to see the collective majority opinion sometimes  These same arguments could be made about Justin Beiber the Kardashians Fifty Shades of Grey or any other popular thing in culture that reddit always hates on

2015-05-30 01:59:34,-2,0,-2,Fifty Shades of Grey,People Honest talk Mad Max was a great film possibly the best action movie of this year so far But it wasnt cheap As of May 27 the film has grossed 100091391 short of breaking even with its estimated budget of 150000000 about how much Fast and Furious 7 made in just its opening weekend and Fifty Shades of Grey made gross Mad Max was a ballsy endeavor to say the least with a high budget for a series that hasnt been in the theater in nearly 30 years and a R rating to go along with it Ill let the numbers speak for themselves but as much as I think this film was great and want to see more if people dont talk about it more and get others to go out and see it the studios thinking about producing films like this will think they are MEDIOCRE

2015-05-01 00:35:41,7,0,7,Gett,Thats one of those scenes where my TV will be on in the background while Im getting ready to go out or something and then the heist sequence starts and even if Im late for an appointment its like Shit guess Ive gotta sit down and watch the next fifteen minutes of this movie
2015-05-01 00:49:18,0,0,0,Gett,I am beginning to think part of that is by design They are getting a lot of headlines for AoU Just when he was talking about IM4 to get additional press he would not have gotten otherwise for just The Judge
2015-05-01 00:49:50,10,0,10,Gett,Thats pretty much it And I mean if the movie was shit it was two bucks Now I love a great movie But movies to me at least are more than whats on the screen I go to school in a small town with two bars and a movie theatre thats the extent off campus entertainment There is just something about driving to the theater and getting my popcorn and slushie and settling in to watch the previews of what I can look forward to with a group of friends There is just something about the magic of movies Ouija wasnt great But it was a first date with a friend that loves scary movies It was stereotypical but it was cheap fun escapism and for two hours I could put aside school and just lose myself in the screen and the people with me Im not an art or film critic just a business major So while there are movies that are amazing the ones that are ok are just that to me ok I dont get offended by movies being bad I just enjoy the time A man once told me that the journey is the destination and its sounds kind of groovy and out there But I can apply that to movies I mean even if the movie wasnt remarkable it was still a trip to the movies

2015-05-01 02:05:25,473,0,473,Gett,Just got back I can see how some people will say this is a bit cramped Personally I loved it but Im also a huge marvel fanboy at this point Vision was just the greatest to me he didnt get much screen time but he was just everything I expected Ultron wassort of likeable In a fucked up sort of way Spader nailed it This universe is just getting started though
2015-05-01 02:22:36,-3,0,-3,Gett,I mean they still had plenty of character development in this Just because the movie is getting more cramped and complex doesnt inherently mean its going to be bad Some movies do bad with cramped others make in interesting I thought how the plot never stopped moving was a plus
2015-05-01 02:29:36,-1,0,-1,Gett,So whats gonna be the opinion on ATJ after seeing him in this Seems his character is getting quite a bit of praise maybe just cause of his fate but maybe not

2015-05-01 02:47:47,10,0,10,Gett,The WWE tends to REALLY dislike when wrestlers go off and do their own thing Theres a wrestler in the WWE named Zack Ryder who started his own YouTube series that did very well and got him major attention He was a relatively unknown guy with a goofy gimmick but was now getting his name chanted during The Rocks speechespromos The WWE ran with it for a bit and the fans were eating it up but then they completely dropped him by making him look really pathetic in storylines and he hasnt had a notable storyline since
2015-05-01 02:50:30,15,0,15,Gett,Theyre definitely a mixed bad  Personally I still love the first Iron Man Guardians and both Captain America films though Im in the minority of people who prefer Cap 1 over Cap 2 and I think The Avengers was actually better on the rewatch my expectations were a little too high on the first watch but I agree that the rest are average or forgettable
2015-05-01 03:02:14,26,0,26,Gett,My buddy just got thru with it He was so hyped for it then somewhere around Captain America The First Avenger I could see him getting demoralized  Monster cans as far as the eye can see He did get a nice medal for it thoughhttpiimgurcom68rlUmzjpg

2015-05-01 03:29:36,7,0,7,Gett,Three days ago The film took the time to breathe and wasnt just okay first we do this thing and next we do this thing and then we do this thing There was no time to breathe in AoU which is where Whedons writing excels The first Avengers movie also had the element of oh man this is so cool theyre all getting together so seeing them all work together while the music swells is no longer a new thing So you need to do something NEW which I dont think they did or at least they tried to and didnt do that well

2015-05-01 05:06:21,8,0,8,Gett,Ya honestly Im kinda starting to think comic movies shouldnt get the comic treatment Movies should be used to tell a single contained character story Do Batman in The Long Halloween Superman in all star Take the stuff that perfectly captures everything the character is and make a movie out of that But marvels way of doing things is just putting the characters on the screen and doing a generic story arc When youre reading a comic you know that the consequences dont matter So writers gotta write some damn good characters Some damn good dialogue And some damn good story and interactions And there wasnt really any of that in this movie I guess its kinda cause its a team movie that we dont get these penultimate character portrayals I dunno between the lack of tension and the constant quips and non serious attitude Im getting really bored of marvel

2015-05-01 05:20:35,7,0,7,Gett,I dont know what to say specifically except the movie just felt flat Ill admit Im getting a little bored of comic movies espcially marvel I loved the first two acts of winter solider and guardians But the 3rd act both seemed to need to check off epic end battle scene where you dont really feel like anyone is in danger
2015-05-01 05:25:16,1,0,1,Gett,While The Avengers took its time getting to the action Age of Ultron opens with an absolutely thrilling sequence that also works in a clever nod to the excellent tracking shot from the original films third act The pace is quickly established in these first few moments and the film rarely lets off the throttle until the end credits resulting in an experience that is exhausting in the best way possible
2015-05-01 05:26:53,6,0,6,Gett,Im 34 and feel the need to back that guy or girl up actually The XMen movies as a whole are pretty forgettable compared to most of the other comic book movies of the past decade or two
2015-05-01 05:43:38,26,0,26,Gett,So I guess Jonah was tired of Josh Gad getting all the funny fat friend jobs and decided to get back in the game
2015-05-01 05:55:25,1,0,1,Gett,Seriously his power level was severely lacking He got soloed by nearly every single Avenger throughout the film Its Ultron He should have been able to solo against 34 Avengers at a time Him getting housed by The Vision made sense but Cap should be childs play for him
2015-05-01 05:55:51,12,0,12,Gett,Ultron always comes back in a new form so thatd be cool Rather than a throwaway villain getting a new Ultron maybe his AI matured over some time Could be the Ultron a lot of people were hoping for Now youve got me hype for something that probably wont happen Shame on you
2015-05-01 05:56:16,0,0,0,Gett,Whedon really overWhedoned the dialogue tbqh Write one character like that and theyre hilarious Write fifteen and it starts getting pretty tired Ultron making the same corny jokes as everyone else definitely made him less menacing

2015-05-01 06:56:44,2,0,2,Gett,I watch and enjoy all of these movies but some fatigue is setting in  Kind of getting overloaded with characters and lack of character development makes it kind of boring   The quiet moments of The Avengers were what made it interesting that and the novelty of seeing them interact  This one felt too cookiecutter action fodder   There were no stakes  Ultron was forgettable  The individual films have more breathing room to actually have some plot
2015-05-01 07:02:49,5,0,5,Gett,I like your frankness but your argumentation is getting weak here Depps movies have been embarrassing flopps for years He is an aging drunk with an PR wife old enough to be his daughter He had to go to rehab while he was shooting his latest movie because his addition is out of control Hollywood unfortunately is always a couple of steps behind what the public thinks is cool Otherwise they wouldnt have lost that much money with putting Depp in movies Downey should be very careful name dropping Depp

2015-05-01 08:40:13,3,0,3,Gett,I doubt he programmed anything in  Thats probably just the reaction the emergent consciousness had to being in a cage  That model however wasnt smart enough to know that just banging against the wall was pointless  This probably gave him the idea to bring in a rube to see if a smarter model would succeed at getting someone to let it out  I dont think he programmed in Avas desire to escape either  I think thats just the result of being an intelligent AI in a box

2015-05-01 09:53:50,3,0,3,Gett,So Im a little confused on something maybe someone here can help me out Didnt Tony blow up all of his suits at the end of Iron Man 3 Doesnt him hanging with the Avengers with a bunch of new suits and a robot army sort of undermine that decision Wouldnt Pepper be pissed Im kind of confused why they bothered to do that in Iron Man 3 since I thought getting Tony back was going to be a crucial plot point in Age of Ultron

2015-05-01 11:54:22,1,0,1,Gett,This movie is amazing I kept getting my mind blown This was like watching a comic book come to life even the wacky moments translated great onto the screen There are just certain moments where youre like thats freaking Vision fighting right next to Thor and Iron Man doing a combo with scarlet witch OMG Everything about it was great no dull moments great depth to characters jokes all around and of course action And Vision jesus the make up is top notch it almost looks fake I need to rewatch this
2015-05-01 12:02:20,3,0,3,Gett,Like Ultron forgetting his words Yeah it was quite forced at times when I first saw Spader in The Office he was actually more threatening in that than here and I thought that they could make him into a really menacing character that would be one of the iconic villains of comic book movies they and Brolin really have to knock it out of the park with Thanos
2015-05-01 12:09:19,72,0,72,Gett,The director Jeremy Gardner and the cinematographer Christian Stella went back to their dayjobs after doing The Batteryhttpwwwimdbcomtitlett2272350 The budget of the movie was 6 000 They barely made money of the movie since despite getting tons of critical acclaim and attention for a very small independent horror movie everybody just pirated the movie

2015-05-01 12:30:25,2,0,2,Gett,And like my experience which wasnt on the internet it was anecdotal It shapes or influences you and you them potentially but the actual statistics and metrics and majority view disagree and as such the objective stance is that they ARE NOT bad movies And honestly calling them bad movies makes no sense when compared to actual bad movies There are things like Transmorphers which have so many sound issues because they are cheapbudget production generic ripoffs that are actually BAD movies But the Star Wars were not terrible movies for their Prequels and you owe them everything for getting you a 7th anyway

2015-05-01 14:18:52,11,0,11,Gett,Im kinda glad that he stayed dead not because he was a bad character or anything but because Im getting kinda tired of characters being presented as dead and then there is a sudden shock reveal and it turns out heshe isnt dead after all That or they have been cured by some contrived circumstance the second rebooted Star Trek film for example For me Quicksilvers death added a level of threat to the final action sequence that just isnt there in many Marvel movies and thus made me appreciate the film that little bit more

2015-05-01 16:24:19,1,0,1,Gett,I think had Marvel known AoU would be coming out so soon after Ex Machina they would have changed the release date  To me AoU REALLY suffers in comparison  Their portrayal of AI and how it could interact with human beings was just so much better  Of course they are completely different movies as no one expects a Marvel movie to be anything but big dumb plots and huge CGI fests of fighting countless minions but thats exactly the problem  You dont have high expectations watching these movies and come away getting exactly what you expected

2015-05-01 17:47:55,2,0,2,Gett,He was most terrifying in the scene with Ulysses Klaw because he genuinely feels like an unhinged psychopath I was hoping for more of that Like he just keeps getting crazier and crazier and more violent and vicious
2015-05-01 17:55:36,12,0,12,Gett,Look it doesnt matter what we want what matters is how to reach mainstream success so they can make money and Jane Foster is that reason because average JoeJane can identity with her I for one dont have a problem with her acting but Thor 2 took place almost entirely in Asguard centered almost entirely around Thor and his people for most of the movie and many people say it was the worst MCU movie to date Replace Jane with Sif getting the Aether stuck in her and you still have the same plot nearly everyone hated So clearly the character of Jane Foster is not the problem Youre allowed not to like her no ones trying to force the issue on you but to say shes unimportant is to not understand the plot to the movies
2015-05-01 18:02:03,2,0,2,Gett,No ones really sure what exactly is getting retconned by DoFP Id say feel free to skip Origins but you should probably watch up to and including Last Stand as it has some important stuff on Jean Gray and Wolverine
2015-05-01 18:19:26,3,0,3,Gett,It will probably be better than an action driven superhero movie and it will also be really refreshing after all this hollow action comedies weve been getting
2015-05-01 18:23:14,-1,0,-1,Gett,I disagree I watched some scenes recently after getting a new tv and it all looks like a video game to me The cgi looks dated already if compared to more recent movies such as  the new planet of the apes
2015-05-01 18:47:05,4,0,4,Gett,Yea the worst was that there was a group of people laughing at Vision I was getting so irritated with that shit Especially when theyre saying Oh hes just like superman  I really hope no one else had to put up with that shit
2015-05-01 18:57:00,3,0,3,Gett,I always thought Speed shouldve turned into an action franchise where Sandra Bullocks character keeps getting into increasingly implausible scenarios with an endless chain of disposable costars
2015-05-01 19:16:00,1,0,1,Gett,Can you please quote me and tell me where I said people are entitled to pirate movies All I was saying was that it isnt as big of a deal as people of the film industry make it out to be because getting rid of piracy wont really help them make even more money than they already do
2015-05-01 19:18:09,48,0,48,Gett,Honestly on that entire schedule the only film on that entire list I could see getting kind of fucked is Tomorrowland Clooney will get the domestic draw going but internationally I think Avengers and Inside Out are probably going to hurt it
2015-05-01 19:28:50,0,0,0,Gett,The trailers before the showing I went to were REALLY disappointing MadMax which Ive now seen way too many times Jurassic World Tomorrowland which did look interesting and was a new trailer for me Poultrygeist remake and if there were any others they were even less memorable oh Spy I think they are getting lazier with their titles I was a bit disappointed to not get BvS or Starwars
2015-05-01 19:42:08,5,0,5,Gett,There was very little information getting in through the Iron Curtain both to and from USSR Because of that stereotypes flourished and grown fertilized by gossips Basically everything common folk knew about USA was what Soviet Propaganda and smuggled movies offered to us You can imagine what image was in the heads of generation who saw only 7080th action movies and was constantly told that USA is our arch nemesis
2015-05-01 19:42:16,6,0,6,Gett,I was getting some strong Milton vibes from Office Space on that scene
2015-05-01 19:48:49,-1,0,-1,Gett,With Age of Ultron getting panned by critics I wonder if Marvel cockriders will realize their hypocrisy in criticizing people who go to watch mindless blockbusters like the Transformers series
2015-05-01 19:49:17,-8,0,-8,Gett,gross thinking of how the rich are getting richer but of all movies this is perhaps the least deserving adults taking refuge in childrens fantasies yuck
2015-05-01 19:58:42,1,0,1,Gett,I never really thought about thathowever I think it could work The whole screaming episode happened when I got a little nervous and then things escalated as I started getting more and more freaked out

2015-05-01 20:34:59,1,0,1,Gett,People also seem to be forgetting that JediSith are borderline psychics so its not as easy as a normal sword fight
2015-05-01 20:38:43,2,0,2,Gett,Please When I rewatched the first Avengers I wasnt sure why they put Hawkeye in the movie Sure plotwise he played a slightly critical role But anyone could have not a named major player of the freakin Avengers though I mean when he was kidnapped and brainwashed by Loki nobody seemed to care or be concerned only Natasha Even when she was letting everyone know Capt literally talked over her and cut her off Hawkeye seemed to be such an ignored player in that movie Im so excited to see his bigger role in this one So excited I didnt even think of it as death flags but rather character development similar to what everyone else was getting due to their nightmares I would have been beyond pissed if they gave his character a proper introduction for the only purpose of tugging at our heart strings when they kill him
2015-05-01 20:52:47,0,0,0,Gett,From the impression Ive been getting all that stuff that was cut was Loki
2015-05-01 20:52:48,2,0,2,Gett,The opening fight scene cgi was Hobbitlike very cartoony The whole movie felt rushed like they are cramming too many things into the movie The best thing was the Black Widow and Hulk romance and also the Hulk getting punched bit This movie is the most kidoriented Marvel movie to date The kids and teenagers will eat all this shit up but but the adults will find it meh
2015-05-01 20:54:36,9,0,9,Gett,Its very enjoyable but ultimately forgettable
2015-05-01 21:06:06,1,0,1,Gett,Thanos is the deep dark in the series manipulating different villains in attempts to bring each of the Infinity Stones to light The end credit scene pretty much spelled out how he had enough of working from the shadows and we can look forwards to him getting his hands dirty
2015-05-01 21:14:21,3,0,3,Gett,Its just another way to reboot everything Weve had prequels sequels and now were getting equals
2015-05-01 21:23:33,2,0,2,Gett,As uknowledgeoverswag said I assumed he was getting tired
2015-05-01 21:34:06,21,0,21,Gett,It really is amazing how many times you can watch it without getting tired of it and Ive never seen a bond stooge lay his neck out like that
2015-05-01 21:41:19,1,0,1,Gett,Wait when is Inside Out supposed to come out I just realized I have no idea when that movie is getting released
2015-05-01 21:47:28,0,0,0,Gett,I have to disagree with this I was talking with my friends after the movie and we all agreed that we liked the specific emphasis this movie had on saving lives They were committed to getting innocent people out of harms way and Banner was haunted by his inability to protect civilians while in combat This is quite a contrast to something like Man of Steel where the fight turned Metropolis into a complete warzone and Superman didnt give a shit
2015-05-01 22:14:46,1,0,1,Gett,Not necessarily IMO the games takes 20 hours because its open world Half of that time is spent running around the map getting to point A to point B
2015-05-01 22:24:13,8,0,8,Gett,It got released a week ago in the UKit seems funny to see you guys getting it late when with most other filmsshows its the other way round and the Internet is dark and full of spoilers
2015-05-01 22:29:00,2,0,2,Gett,So thats what Thor 3 is gonna be about then Thanos getting the Gauntlet  Because Phase 3 is gonna be a massive game of Kill the Carrier with the Infinity Stones and Gauntlet as the football
2015-05-01 22:31:31,3,0,3,Gett,Yeah two trilogies that had nothing to do with each other in terms of continuity  That is why once again SpiderMan is getting rebooted this time into Marvels Cinematic Universe  His character has never appeared or was mentioned in Iron ManThorCaptain AmericaHulk series at all  They fought an entire battle in the center of NYC and not one mention of SpiderMan was ever discussed  He has not been established into the MCU  His previous 5 movies dont mean anything to Marvel
2015-05-01 22:32:02,3,0,3,Gett,The way Ive always explained it to people is that the sequels depict Max as a legend the movies are so bonkers because youre getting a secondhand account of the things that happened The first movie though youre seeing Max as he really isjust a man Hes not a legend hes not a Warrior hes just a guy living in a shitty world Its jarring to some people because its not waaay ridiculous just really grim I saw it first before the sequels but my wife watched it last and I think it had more impact with her
2015-05-01 22:44:25,2,0,2,Gett,Oh man That Hulk endingcould we be getting Planet Hulk
2015-05-01 23:12:31,1,0,1,Gett,Right I know what you were getting at
2015-05-01 23:25:48,1,0,1,Gett,35 hour movies are generally a problem for a several reasons audience fatigue cinemas getting less turnaround etc There are of course one or two examples but those are the extreme exception and many of them were still criticized for being too long
2015-05-01 23:37:32,2,0,2,Gett,I had absolutely no idea what was happening and were people where during these awesome action sequences There was just so much crap cluttering the screen during the opening scene that just made the whole thing incoherent There was that bit where Scarjo was just getting up and i swear it cut about 3 or 4 times just to show that she was standing Im not one to complain about explosions and chaos in an action film but at least give said explosions purpose you know
2015-05-01 23:41:48,47,0,47,Gett,I actually felt like Connor was least involved in anything He had no connection to the Assassins he lived his entire life as a native not giving a fuck aobut western world He was thrown into all of it and his only motives were revenge and gettingt that one guy he had no deeper personality he was mundane
2015-05-01 23:43:09,2,0,2,Gett,His character getting killed off would probably be for the best given how much better the Evan PetersXMen version was
2015-05-01 23:51:03,1,0,1,Gett,AoU was releasted 7pm as Avengers was released at midnight I dont understand why this is getting overlooked
2015-05-01 23:55:53,2,0,2,Gett,Now that you mention that about Ultron I can totally see every avenger getting a super villain to fight in infinity wars Cap gets red skull since he was sucked up by the Teseract Thor gets Loki Iron man fights Ultron At least it would be cool even though it would be a mess to have so many people
2015-05-02 00:05:19,1,0,1,Gett,Hes getting his clocks cleaned
2015-05-02 00:05:21,-4,0,-4,Gett,So what There are several reasons movies can go bad If M Night Shamaylan and Zack Snyder can keep getting chances why would they pull the plug over one movie which already had a bunch of issues thanks to the studio If he was kicked off it was probably do to either personal reasons or he is pissing the wrong people off
2015-05-02 00:25:49,9,0,9,Gett,The girl getting her pic taken behind stark has to be on the internet somewhere
2015-05-02 01:10:17,1,0,1,Gett,Hes always had trouble getting around but he can get up long enough for his scenes
2015-05-02 01:41:59,83,0,83,Gett,Say what you will about how unfortunate it is that a badass filmmaker like Josh Trank is being fired from star warsbut as weve already seen from the controversy over the reshoots and set stories on F4 Trank obviously isnt all that hes cracked up to be  And dont say hes an artist he does it his way and fights the studio  BS  Id rib him right in the gut after the alleged stories of how rude he was to his crew and how he showed up on set high and inarticulate  People DREAM for these director jobs and here we have a typical Frat boy whos squandering it because hes higher than everyone else after getting lucky with Chroncle I dont hate the guy but I couldnt be happier that amidst all this trouble hes walking away from this Star Wars project
2015-05-02 01:53:01,7,0,7,Gett,I think its also no coincidence that it increases the MPAAs chances of getting donations and funding from conservative politicians
2015-05-02 02:10:37,2,0,2,Gett,My main negative from this film is that Ultron was such a non character  The only time the Avengers looked close to getting stopped wasnt even by him it was Scarlet Witch mind fucking them  Ultron did almost nothing all movie
2015-05-02 02:36:07,1,0,1,Gett,Hmm  Thats not too bad honestly given how Fantastic 4 is looking i was getting worried it would be another Chronicle in Space
2015-05-02 03:03:48,2,0,2,Gett,Same here I dont even notice any of the other ones And even going through the list I only remember Adidas from Quicksilver getting dressed I probably didnt notice it because I saw it as QS putting on shoes rather than putting on Adidas Whats he supposed to wear Shoes Brand Sneakers
2015-05-02 03:10:42,1,0,1,Gett,I saw There Will Be Blood in theaters without knowing anything about it other than it had been getting major Oscar buzz I usually dont see those types of movies in theater but I was stuck in a town away from home with a friend and we had a few hours to kill so we decided to see it Its now one of my favorite movies Its a long movie so I definitely understand the hesitation but you should definitely give it a shot
2015-05-02 03:18:39,1,0,1,Gett,I just dont think he gives a fuck about movies anymore Hes getting paid to vacation and hang out with his friends while cutting them a fat check Cant say that I blame him as long as they keep giving him money hes gonna keep taking it
2015-05-02 03:32:16,1,0,1,Gett,Uhoh looks like the decision of making everything canon including comics and games is getting in the way of creativity
2015-05-02 03:38:54,12,0,12,Gett,Blazing Saddles does not limit its comedy to any one particular race like Native Americans but it doesnt belittle the culture in the way that this Adam Sandler movie seems to be doing  The Adam Sandler movie is getting a hard time mainly because of its treatment of the actors but the demeaning and unfunny jokes arent helping the situation
2015-05-02 03:44:07,4,0,4,Gett,Yeah its funny People getting squashed all over the place and Stark is having a gay old time crackin wise Before my next statement I wanna say I liked the movie as a whole
2015-05-02 03:48:25,1,0,1,Gett,I stand by my idea of getting indians with heavy accents to play the native american parts
2015-05-02 03:57:37,7,0,7,Gett,The plot about having to kill every Ultron bot to prevent him from returning also leaves a thread hanging if I were Ultron in that position after getting disconnected from the grid first thing Id do would be to slip a lone copy unnoticed in the middle of all the mayhem to hide in the opposite end of the world as insurance
2015-05-02 04:08:18,8,0,8,Gett,I liked the pairing quite a bit But the execution was off The movie shouldve showed them getting closer as the movie wore on where she gradually learns to calm The Hulk side and through that they become closer
2015-05-02 04:14:17,2,0,2,Gett,Its not so much having a study so much as violence in movies never getting the complaints and reactions from the American public that sexuality does  Remember the costume malfunction at the halftime show  People lost their shit over a nipple slip
2015-05-02 04:20:04,21,0,21,Gett,Well consider this  This isnt just some folks getting mad at stupid names and asswiping jokes
2015-05-02 04:26:48,2,0,2,Gett,the trick to getting away with it is actually being funny
2015-05-02 04:46:56,2,0,2,Gett,One scene involved a Native woman pissing in the nude while casually smoking a shamanic peacepipe basically defiling a sacred tribal symbol and another involved the feathers comprising another sacred symbol getting rearranged to make a sexuallyvulgar shape more defiling yeah this is about more than just dumbass naming
2015-05-02 04:53:13,1,0,1,Gett,Why must he hate himself Sounds like hes got a pretty good thing going Getting paid to go on vacations do a little acting along the way Probably have a lot of fun doing it People make a little money a niche audience enjoys a movie whatever I dont watch them they dont get my money but it sounds like its working for him
2015-05-02 05:07:58,1,0,1,Gett,I guess adam sandler just getting desperate for laughs thats hes resulting to shock laughs The older you get the more you see his movies are very crappy and basically the same except for a small handful of movies that are ok
2015-05-02 05:18:40,5,0,5,Gett,I felt that the Turing test was passed at the very end when she turns out to have been manipulating everyone One would only manipulate others because they have a goal in mind in which they use others as resources to reach it showing she was conscious of her own being and developed a need to succeed in living by getting out
2015-05-02 05:29:20,4,0,4,Gett,I feel good for getting that one now XD pretty much exactly what I said to the guy next to me
2015-05-02 05:30:48,1,0,1,Gett,I just got off the phone with Netflix I told them if this movie ever sees the light of day on their wallet Im pulling my subscription I was told that they are looking into it They also said that theyve been getting a lot of feedback on this film and based off past situations there is a chance it could be dropped but what they need and want is more feedback
2015-05-02 05:32:52,2,0,2,Gett,My mom was experiencing them fairly often and I was always saying it was just a dream which it kind of was but shit got real when I experienced it I started to do research on what kind of thing it was I was ecstatic to know that lots of people go through it and that its relatively normal Makes getting through them easier now when ever one pops up Although I havent really experienced one latelythat might changethat image of a shadow standing at the doorway really got to me
2015-05-02 05:34:23,3,0,3,Gett,Id be surprised if all this doesnt end in Marvel getting the F4 rights back
2015-05-02 05:40:37,2,0,2,Gett,Sigh Me too I really really meant to watch it last Fall when my African history course read Heart of Darkness the book its based on minus the setting and the war aspect but I didnt wind up getting around to it
2015-05-02 05:53:24,5,0,5,Gett,o god i laughed so hard at that when they were getting all smoochy thats all i could think of
2015-05-02 05:55:17,0,0,0,Gett,As much as Adam Sandler makes pathetic movies and there were no doubt some things that would bother some people the type of people who go out of their way to get offended people need to stop getting so buthurt about things in comedy
2015-05-02 06:05:45,1,0,1,Gett,Im currently reading a bunch of screenplays to help motivate myself to write You think the ones that make it to screen are bad just try getting through some of the rejected screenplays floating around out there Try reading the 1983 script of BatmanhttpthebatmanuniversenetimageGeneralDownloadsScriptsThe20Batman20Revised20First20Draftpdf Id say it has its moments when it starts but by the time you reach the third act it gets so bad youll feel like Ernest Hemingway
2015-05-02 06:17:40,0,0,0,Gett,I gave it a try but the stupid decisions and actions like McCartneys character selfie filming himself while getting attacked in the van no thank you
2015-05-02 06:44:41,2,0,2,Gett,Remember how in the movie funny people  they talked about how retarded his movies are but hes actually a pretty funny guy Well I used to laugh my ass off when I was a kidgetting stoned with my friends listening to his tapes The goat etc But aside from a few movies he didnt create IE punch drunk love funny people His own movies really are fucking terrible imo I may chuckle here and there at water boy or little nicky But I just cant smoke enough weed to stomach his movies There just to stupid
2015-05-02 07:04:32,1,0,1,Gett,So how does Adam Sandler seriously keep getting budget for this shit when Broke lizard has to crowd fund Super Troopers 2
2015-05-02 07:06:23,4,0,4,Gett,Yeah I agree completely I would like to see the relationship escalate in the new movie and as you said I think the way she can calm Hulk down is a great touch but they should have been getting closer as the movie went on
2015-05-02 07:10:57,3,0,3,Gett,Im glad he had a toned down role in this movie hes been in 5 movies so far and Im just getting tired of his character I would like him to go away until infinity wars that way when he shows up were like oh man Iron Man is back we havent seen him in years thats sweet At this point Im really glad they are adding new characters to the line up Do I like Iron Man Yes I do I just want him to go on a little Avengers vacation for awhile
2015-05-02 07:55:15,7,0,7,Gett,Well you know its not real and people arent actually getting hurt and it seems youre more interested in the character development

2015-05-02 09:52:19,1,0,1,Gett,Yes but tension doesnt come simply from death No one cares when a bunch of extras get blown to bits Its a combination of writing and visualization that creates tension that makes you fear for a character whether it is fear of death fear of them getting caught in a lie or simply fear of them missing a dinner Good directors use the tools available to them to affect the viewer emotionally to create and manipulate tone The tension doesnt come from a director randomly killing people in past movies

2015-05-02 13:03:16,1,0,1,Gett,What I was getting at is there is an entire scene of Adam Sandlers shitty movies he made in the past as the character in Funny People Its just ironic that he started taking that route in the future in real life
2015-05-02 13:06:36,1,0,1,Gett,I felt the same way about the waitress in the first avengers movie At the time I thought it was a really unsubtle way of getting people to care about civilians It was only later I found out that she was supposed to be someone that Captain America had a passing interest in

2015-05-02 13:15:23,7,0,7,Gett,Nothing too bad during the film you dont see innocent civilians getting killed or anything Violence is limited to henchmen being thrown in the air and heavy punches being landed between various parties Perhaps 10 just so they get their head around the plot and some dialogue
2015-05-02 13:23:19,29,0,29,Gett,For me the funniest part was when Rhodey told his heroic story to Stark and Thor and they didnt even react But then he recited the same story to a couple of partygoers and upon getting the reaction he wanted he nodded a damn right

2015-05-02 14:46:18,10,0,10,Gett,This doesnt point to the reason for him getting fired It does seem like this probably resulted in Sony not protesting when Marvel suggested going with a younger actor though
2015-05-02 14:50:37,2,0,2,Gett,I wouldve sacrificed the humor if it meant getting more insight on what was motivating him I mean yeah if you took the character as he was but took out the jokes he might as well have not been in the movie But the reason so many of us hate his humor is because we were expecting some seriously well thoughtout dialogue about him and his robophilosophy about how he saw the world I wanted to see him just totally corner everyone in their arguments because he has infinite knowledge from the Internet and is capable of calculating his every response before you even say what youre going to say Instead it was a brief monologue at the beginning that only gave a very basic you guys suck death is the only kind of peace and then just quips and jokes for the rest of his screen time

2015-05-02 15:44:55,1,0,1,Gett,Oh man dont get me started on how they reduced Black Widow to a one note love struck woman UghI think Capt 2 set up how relationships should build between characters with Steve and Nat trusting each other Hulk and Nat came from nowhere between the movies and it takes up almost all of Black Widows story line What happened to the assassin Yes she has cool scenes and theres nothing wrong with her getting a love interest but when she literally has no other reason for being in the group this movie other than wanting to be with the Hulk it feels forced and unnatural for her character
2015-05-02 15:46:44,-2,0,-2,Gett,Ok so protestraise hell and get your government to stop honoring Americas copyright laws Countries work together to honor copyright laws your government can choose to withdraw and create their own copyright laws I imagine getting out of the treaties and contracts would be difficult but they shouldnt have been signed by your country in the first place if it wasnt a good deal Your country would most likely be cut off from all contect of the major studios too but Im sure you can come up with better stuff

2015-05-02 16:15:25,3,0,3,Gett,Well that is just fucking stupid Intellectual property doesnt exist because we believe people have a fundamental right to exercise perpetual control over every single idea they have it exists because we want to encourage people to share their ideas and invest time money and effort into innovation so we incentivize them to do so by guaranteeing them a temporary monopoly on the ability to monetize their ideas But as we extend the limit on that monopoly we get dimishing returns on our concession if 50 years isnt a good enough oncentive 100 years probably isnt either IP law exists to benefit everyone not just people who own intellectual property When copyrights and patents last too long society is giving up more to IP holders than it is getting back
2015-05-02 16:23:35,1,0,1,Gett,Hopefully Baron Zemo in Cap 3 will have a little more substance In truth Hydra was getting stale between both Cap movies and AoS The MCU really only needs one solid Baron character That said Im pretty sure Baron Mordo will be in Doctor Strange
2015-05-02 16:26:50,1,0,1,Gett,What I mean is that the reward was a thirty second scene with some colors flying around If you dont know the lore already that scene is too fast to mean anything Thor spent longer getting Selvig and getting to the pool than anything else  too much plot for the character development

2015-05-02 16:46:49,2,0,2,Gett,What about Giddyap 1950 Im guessing youve never heard of it My problem with copyright is mostly the protection of items with very little commercial value I cant pirate Steamboat Willie and thats annoying but Disney still goes out of its way to sell me a copy The process for getting Giddyap until a few years ago was to track down a copy on VHS or find it on a film reel Something like Ico el caballito valiente is even harder to find a legal copy
2015-05-02 16:49:01,1,0,1,Gett,Research protections which are a different kind of protection exist so people can make tangible returns off of the work they do in all of those other fields Do you really expect everyone to want to invest their time and money for the intangible good of society without getting paid for it
2015-05-02 17:02:45,16,0,16,Gett,That was one of my gripes as well The ending established where Thor 3 was headed but completely missed a good leadin for Civil War I thought they were getting there with the fight between them earlier in the movie but to see them all chummy at the very end was a bit of a letdown

2015-05-02 17:30:30,11,0,11,Gett,This is what happens when big franchises put a lot of faith in relatively inexperienced directors Its kind of crazy that a film like Chronicle made for 12 million can be enough to secure you the job for a movie 10x more expensive with no other work Even more crazy but more successful was Gareth Edwards getting Godzilla after making Monsters for well under 1 million I guess its because Hollywood arent really producing as many midbudget movies anymore but its kind of insane that these studios are hiring people with experience only on much smaller films or TV for such colossal projects Were probably going to see people pulling out or being fired pretty often as a result
2015-05-02 17:32:37,3,0,3,Gett,Okay heres some Civil War comicbook spoilers relating to this In the final battle in New York City Cap and Tony square off with Rogers getting his ass kicked due to the Iron Man suits memory of every move Rogers has ever used However the Vision disables the suits primary functioning in a sneak attack on Tony This version of the Vision was created by Ultron as an insult against Hank Pym who created James Spader
2015-05-02 17:35:26,5,0,5,Gett,gtRight which is why every major motion picture Disney has put out has starred Mickey Mouse right Most of the Disney classics ended up with one or two shitty directtoDVD sequels and then that was it Were still getting new content from them despite them having an extended copyright on their original projects so there goes that argument
2015-05-02 17:46:29,2,0,2,Gett,Im not anti capitalist Im against getting paid for something someone did 30 years ago I get paid for the work I did this week I dont see how it would be fair of I kept getting paid for work I did in the past I just think its really really entitled 30 years is a whole generation gap and technology exists to digitally replicate anything at virtually no cost so I cant see why these people think they should be able to hold copyrights for 70 years other than greed

2015-05-02 18:11:34,0,0,0,Gett,OK but how long should you or your family continue to collect rents on your works  Currently its 70 years after death  In my family the people dying 70 years ago were my great great grandparents  I have never met any of them nor have my parents  Only the few remaining members of my grandparents generation have ever met them and yet had they written a novel or screenplay Id be getting a check every year because of it
2015-05-02 18:12:39,0,0,0,Gett,Well the thousands of smaller films arent being presently remade by Hollywood studios so it seems beside the point per your argument If Wizard of Oz is only getting converted now because its so popular and this popularity would cause it to be done for free by fans then the popular ones that the studios are willing to convert and thus enable us to pirate would be made by fans as well due to their popularity The ones that fans wont spend the time converting are also the ones that the studios wont convert so the studios converting the movie is of no special value since theyre not doing anything that wouldnt be done by the public
2015-05-02 18:19:40,5,0,5,Gett,IMO it should have been Hawkeye that blocked Quicksilver from getting shot Then Hawkeye should have said You didnt see that coming

2015-05-02 18:33:43,4,0,4,Gett,True but really good directors really work hard at getting scripts right to begin with fixed or rework themselves The problem with Trevorrow is that all he has done is one decent film  so theres really no track record to speak to know whether he has a clue or not I think Nolan was really onto something when he said it was very problematic given people who had done only one film a major Hollywood blockbuster we see it first with Trank the guy who did ASM and ASM2 and now probably with Trevorrow when or if JP4 sucks I think execs might want to take a step back or two about their hiring practices and instead try to work people up the system  like they did with Nolan

2015-05-02 19:13:03,0,0,0,Gett,One reason that these copyrights keep getting extended is because there are heirs of the creators still alive who have an interest in continuing the creation for mainly money and sometimes to keep a brands reputation Mickey will be private domain until long after Disney goes out of business which will not be in our lifetime

2015-05-03 14:17:14,47,0,47,Gett,I thought that was because the core of Ultrons personality was derived from Tony He constantly hates getting compared to Stark throughout the movie but has the same kind of snark and mannerisms he does while personifying his absolutely worst qualities

2015-05-03 14:58:54,1,0,1,Gett,I dont think its against the rules of the DGA for someone else  to help direct a movie What is against the rules is for Vaughn getting co billing or credit as a directer they could reshoot 80 of the movie with Vaughn as director but Trank would still get the directing credit
2015-05-03 15:17:24,4,0,4,Gett,Id much rather watch an episodic Black Widow show Shes a spy which means she works alone for the most part and having her infiltrate someplace that leads into another would be interesting But were already getting similar to that with the Jessica Jones story later in the year

2015-05-03 20:32:14,2,0,2,Gett,Obviously having a huge suit fighting The Hulk everytime they need him to calm down isnt the best route Thats why its shown twice that Black Widow uses her moves to calm him down Their fight scene was mostly meaning but there was reasoning Scarlett Witch was affecting all the Avengers minds in the scene so she was affecting Hulks too Thats why he is rampaging and needs someone to stop him It ties into The Hulk not feeling he can be trusted or be normal The problem that you may be having is they just kinda throw it in there and dont build upon it There rushing and no fleshing out of anything in this filmin a general level The action doesnt allow the eye to focus on anything so everything comes across as sloppy and way too ambitious Henceforth there is no suspense and makes it quite forgettable Winter Soldier is one of my favs along with Iron Man and GoTG and the action was so mich better in WS Im glad that the new directors of Avengers 3 are the directors behind Cap 2 and Cap Civil War So if Avengers 3 ends up like this beautiful mess of Avengers 2 then we know its Marvels fault and not the filmmakers

2015-05-03 22:45:13,1,0,1,Gett,Supermans origin is fine in the DCCU the thing with DC is they are taking heroes and villians from different eras and have found a great way of putting them together for example the Batman we are getting will be a seasoned fighter the Lex Luther we are getting will be based on All Star Superman rumor and Aquaman is based on his run from the nineties minus the hook hand

2015-05-04 00:05:37,1,0,1,Gett,Youre forgetting it was a teaser trailer It didnt really show their team dynamic sure but apart from Sue and Doom if you want to count him in we all got a glimpse of their powers all the while revealing not much storywise which Im glad about So the analogy doesnt really stand You could compare it to a Star Wars teaser that doesnt show Luke and Leia and their brothersister dynamic or Han and Chewie both behind the wheel of the Millenium Falcon

2015-05-04 12:06:52,10,0,10,Gett,I never read the book and wasnt familiar with the previous mini series I really loved it but I can see how a lot of people wouldnt like it Its a thriller where the plot and action are 100 driven by conversation If you arent paying attention you miss important details No spoilers the film uses Gary Oldmans glasses as a vehicle The film starts with him getting fitted for new glasses So when they show him with different glasses hes remembering the past I totally missed that and didnt pickup on it till a second viewing This movie is BEAUTIFUL Its finely crafted Cinematography set design soundtrack it all fits together gorgeously But like I said theres almost no action its all exposition Its this taut flat style appropriate for characters looking for facts As long as youre ready for that youll enjoy it

2015-05-04 14:16:04,67,0,67,Gett,Im calling it here  The Civil War movie is not going to be what you think it will be  Its not going to be anything like the comics even in a general form  Just like the Age of Ultron lasted all of 34 inuniverse days in the MCU the Civil War will most likely have nothing to do with Cap and Iron Man fighting  Itll be centered around some easily dispatched villain and a ton of cameo villains getting killed off  Literally everyone in the MCU right now people know their identity  No ones identity is kept secret from another  Maybe Daredevil but hes likely not to have anything to do with this movie which is disappointing as hed be perfect for it

2015-05-04 14:52:12,1,0,1,Gett,What I love about this is that it appears to be getting back to the gritty type world we saw in the Original Trilogy Just because there were amazing technological advances life wasnt pretty for everyone In the New Trilogy we saw many beautiful landscapes and worlds While these do exist in the Star Wars universe we didnt see much of the underbelly and saw many glamorous images I think there is a balance between the two and it looks like Abrams is starting with the grittier look of things

2015-05-04 15:09:55,12,0,12,Gett,Well Superman has lived for 75 years with out people getting bored with him So I think they can keep going for a long time Superheros as a genre dont have the same narrative arch as a traditional story The characters are Gods and the conflict and interest of the story comes from the struggle of Gods Either Marvels traditional approach of Gods being humanized and dealing with the same issues that mere mortals have to like Spiderman balancing his check book or Iron Mans alcoholism Or DCs approach of the ethics of being saviors and being straight up better than humans but some how still respecting and supporting them Death would rarely make these struggles more interesting Now the  business side forced the creation of this style of story telling no one is denying that but that doesnt mean the different form is some how not valid

2015-05-04 18:16:55,1,0,1,Gett,I agree people outside of those that read comics realize that their are different universes where heroes of the same name are portrayed vastly different than what the canon story line portrays People were up in arms about Letos Joker and are up in arms about this personally I like it a lot and cant wait to see what is going to come of it And the only reason DC is staying away from the R category for movies is mostly because they still want the kids today to be a key demographic and excluding that audience may mean for a better movie for adults but it leads to less kids getting interested exposed to comic book characters although like I said some of the new 52 stuff may not be the greatest for kids either haha

2015-05-04 18:39:18,1,0,1,Gett,Thanks for adding to the discussion For the record Im willing to admit that the downvotes Im getting could be because my ideas arent wellthought out or articulated  I like debating movies with people so if someone wants to downvote because Im wrong thats okay  If they want to downvote because Im challenging the herdmentality    well its just the internet Its all right

2015-05-04 19:14:54,9,0,9,Gett,I completely disagree The mental pressure Stark has been under for the past 3 movies IM1 IM2 and Avengers has just gotten bigger and bigger and in the end somethings gotta give Its not about his mortality its about everyone elses Theres a reason hes willing to take a nuke through a wormhole with no expectation of getting back
2015-05-04 19:18:33,1,0,1,Gett,Well Ive only seen the Star Treks and Super 8 and I thought they were really boring uninspired and forgettable movies I dont want to see anybody do bad so I hope he makes something interesting and memorable this time Excited for the movie so far

2015-05-04 19:29:02,9,0,9,Gett,He was coated in it in his final form and the Avengers took about 3 seconds to just blow it off before getting back to killing all his drones while he whimpered off and killed Quicksilver so we could feel sad for a character that was introduced 2 hours beforehand
2015-05-04 19:29:07,6,0,6,Gett,It hasnt been confirmed obviously but I would expect part 1 to be an introduction to the Infinity Gauntlet with maybe the current avengers trying to fight Thanos and realizing hes too powerful so then part 2 would be them getting everybody together to take him down
2015-05-04 19:34:24,1,0,1,Gett,People are very quick to point out how much they hated IM23 Thor 2 and even Age of Ultron has been getting quite a few complaints about pacingdialogue issues recently
2015-05-04 19:56:08,2,0,2,Gett,So the protagonist doesnt fight back in the sense of fisticuffs so much but I just watched New Zealand horrorcomedy Housebound and the heroine is very interested in getting shit done and not just being a victim I loved it and think theres a lot of crossover appeal to Youre Next with both having weird dark comedy
2015-05-04 20:18:05,1,0,1,Gett,Yeah The real problem WB is having is getting people who have an institutional knowledge of the characters
2015-05-04 20:21:12,-4,0,-4,Gett,Thats actually pretty dumbsafe humorjust saying there wasnt much risk of people not getting the joke
2015-05-04 20:22:47,2,0,2,Gett,Its not necessarily a bad thing but I think you should at least be savvy enough to recognize that youre only getting part of a bigger story Just because its your money theyre fucking with Take it assimilate it into your knowledge Just a consumer tip  you would want to know if some guy was trying to sell you a car with missing parts Some people are in such denial they reject that entire premise

2015-05-04 20:37:16,1,0,1,Gett,I kind of took the biggest take away from IM3 that Stark was no longer living in the beach house It helps explain why they all seem to be living and working in Stark tower in AoU Cap even says he cant afford an apartment anymore when he clearly had one during the events of Winter Soldier I think the biggest thing was getting them all living and working under one roof and having that make some sense
2015-05-04 20:42:39,1,0,1,Gett,Its okay but nothing special I was looking forward to it but once it was over it didnt stay with me at all and was pretty forgettable like it was justthere Otherwise though there some pretty good moments
2015-05-04 20:52:20,1,0,1,Gett,I remember watching it as a kid I dont think I understood most of it but I did like it I saw it again a few years ago as an adult and I was surprised at how dark it was Somehow a woman getting a bloody hole blown through her stomach with a shotgun didnt faze me when I was younger
2015-05-04 20:57:55,25,0,25,Gett,They did a very good job of world building in the movie A prequel would be good but an alternate timeline SideQuel would be amazing Wicks on his rampage and we watch another assassin do their thing while getting reports back

2015-05-04 21:47:21,7,0,7,Gett,Marvel may have worked hard but they have their problems as well LIke Quicksilver appearing in both the Avengers amp XMen but the Avengers not being able to mention Magneto or call the twins mutants and XMen unable to mention the Avengers Studio rights are a bitch Can you imagine how much bigger Civil War would be everyone was allowed to appear together It was hard enough getting Sony to allow SpiderMaqn to appear in Civil War
2015-05-04 21:52:14,-3,0,-3,Gett,Or John just liked getting paid in gold so paying for revenge with the same gold regardless of how much change he should be getting is just funny and convenient Like a rich guy that always tips 100 just because its easier than doing the math

2015-05-04 22:35:05,5,0,5,Gett,I see what youre saying But it gives me a very Flash Gorden vibe Like its really getting to the roots of some of the stuff that inspired Lucas in the first place

2015-05-04 23:38:32,2,0,2,Gett,Thats a very flawed argument Star Wars as a whole overarching story Episodes 16 Do you think that could be told in 90 minutes too Certainly not very well I dunno if youve read the book but I am very happy theyre taking this approach Maybe another TV series would have been best but this is a close second I hate the fact that films are getting so split up these days when they dont need to be Mockingjay The Hobbit Harry Potter etc but this is one of those rare cases where it just makes so much sense

2015-05-05 02:14:00,1,0,1,Gett,I wouldnt say I love them but I get more value out of the enjoyment of the movie than I pay for the ticket  They are getting old though  Iron Man 1 and 2 are still my favorite of the bunch  Avengers just seems too crowded imo
2015-05-05 02:29:18,1,0,1,Gett,I felt the same when I heard they were making a sequel about two months ago Im getting real deja vu here The story works well when you only get a glimpse of the underworld You can imagine them spinning it out and making a TV series which would ruin it a bit

2015-05-05 03:12:24,3,0,3,Gett,I would really like if part 1 had all the heroes assembled by the end and finished with them getting beaten badly The new avenger team seems pretty average most of their power is in Scarlet Witch and Vision but wont Vision have to die at some point for the stone Also maybe a dumb question but does Thanos attack earth in Infinity Wars

2015-05-05 18:06:16,-1,0,-1,Gett,There are a ton of mechanics to this and very few of them are the sexist internet fires people want to make them out to be  There are fewer female superhero moviesleads simply because there are fewer popular female superheroes  I think were forgetting that until the past two decades good super hero movies were rare period  That there is nearly an entire century of written media dominated by male figures who have an enormous fan base solely in the male side of culture  That aside from a small handful of characters there are very few popular female supers  That of course is changing and Im happy about it but for a studio to take that wager is probably a very risky proposition  Aside from Wonderwoman Batgirl and Supergirl most female characters even our beloved Black Widow sat on the edge of cultural obscurity until recently  Seriously does the female side of our newly birthed hero culture even know Ms marvel exists  I doubt the numbers a studio needs to put forth a film do  The only reason were getting one now is probably because people will go see anything with MARVEL attached to it  The nearly 100 failure rate of the email mentioned movies is extremely important to the business side of things  It highlights the risks involved  Its not sexist its marketing  Supergirl is especially notable because it premiered at a time when ole Supes and the movie momentum of his films was at a huge high and it failed  Sure it was an awful movie but it released long before the internet was around to spotlight a movies failures  There should have been crowds flocking to see it  you know like Superman 3 and 4 sort of both had  So there is a solid argument to be made that people didnt go not because it was bad but because it was Supergirl unpopular with culture and not Superman extremely popular  I know there is a sexist bias in our superhero world and Im glad to see it going away  But change takes time and there is a lot of money and business involved in this  SO we need to stop crying foul every time things dont go the way our overly sensitive society isnt getting its way fast enough

2015-05-05 19:19:03,5,0,5,Gett,I agree that having more flawed heroes and more villains with actual merits is something that really needs to happen but I dont get your conclusion that the movies need to have villains being their own undoing or a completely different character defeating the villain How would that be more interesting than whats going on right now Id much rather watch the main heroes actually taking care of the problems by themselves than see them getting bailed out or having the villain accidentally defeat himself That just sounds kind of cheap

2015-05-06 12:42:45,1,0,1,Gett,Couldnt disagree more The film needed more of that stuff Marvel have done a hundred falling buildings and maniacal bad guys Getting to the heart of the characters was an incredibly important part of it Especially as it offered the chance for scenes like the woodchopping argument A bit more downtime wouldve made the set pieces stand out
2015-05-06 12:52:40,1,0,1,Gett,Someone above posted the actual tweets with the profile pictures  Take a look at them  Not a single one looks over 23 multicolored hair multiple facial piercings etc  None of those things bother me Im  just saying that they are all obviously the same social group and definitely none of them adverse to getting attention or generating drama  I guess Im saying that drama is exactly what most of those attackers want

2015-05-06 13:43:48,1,0,1,Gett,Yeah fair enough I can understand that someone who has zero familiarity with the franchise to feel that this is just some dumb Hollywood blockbuster with ridiculous overthetop action scenes However I think that most people who went to see this movie knew what they were getting into As someone whos followed the franchise from the very beginning even I loved this movie Of course its stupid ridiculous overthetop and bombastic but its still awesome Not sure if its just because Im invested in the characters but at almost 15 billion seems like a lot of people enjoyed it Although Transformers 4 made a lot of money and that was probably the worst movies Ive ever seen

2015-05-06 14:09:55,1,0,1,Gett,I think Marvel needs to look into getting someone to make actual great posters instead of renders slapped onto a background This is one of the things that bothers me the most about the MCU movies
2015-05-06 14:14:31,5,0,5,Gett,Probably because cinemas want these big eyecatching posters with all the actors getting nice billing Looks good grabs eyes makes actors happy
2015-05-06 14:49:46,1,0,1,Gett,I was more trying to say that theres no use trying to fight it or give reasons why they shouldnt do it Its already happening so we should be getting used to it talking about how they can do it successfully or trying to avoid it

2015-05-06 15:31:48,2,0,2,Gett,Its trilogy  a lot of the first movie is setting up the plot and getting things rolling If youre interested in the action parts of the movie those arent going to pop up until at least halfway through the movie when the get to Moria
2015-05-06 15:44:15,-2,0,-2,Gett,The bubble will burst probably by Infinity War and the first sign was when they announced their slate of Marvel movies for the next 10 years Thats great we know what we are getting but not all of those movies will perform as well as others and Marvel will have to adjust the slate changing existing storylines and future ones because they decided to pull their dick out and show us back in 2014 Also the whole teasing of Thanos for the past few years is going to wear very thin by the time Infinity War releases That movie better be fuckin epic or the bubble will burst in Marvels face there or before
2015-05-06 15:46:47,1,0,1,Gett,Well itll have to be someone else because Marvels already doing a movie with Carol Danvers but sure The point I was getting at though is that I really didnt mind Paquins characterization because its basically Year One Rogue which isnt what a lot of people are used to The younger fans especially only know the wild southern belle because of her portrayal in games cartoons amp current comics  they didnt get to see how she was in her earlier years

2015-05-06 16:38:07,3,0,3,Gett,It was controversial for the filmmakers because it was almost rated NC17 due to a girl getting oral sex something that happens with guys all the time in movies  so it seemed like the MPAA felt that female pleasure was more faus pas than male pleasure
2015-05-06 16:45:06,1,0,1,Gett,Im not saying all planned trilogies are a good thing I just dont see how unplanned sequels are inherently better than planned ones They are either even or worse Though the trend these days is sequels are getting better and better

2015-05-06 18:31:58,29,0,29,Gett,God I love that movie Some changes were made to the script due to the same Lolitay feels getting to close to home In the original script they do become lovers Jean Reno also felt that if he made Lon sound a bit slow then both characters would be seen on more of an equal footing and not incinuate that Lon was trying to take advantage of the girl

2015-05-06 20:15:24,36,0,36,Gett,I think that was his way of letting her down gently  He knew that getting angry or saying how wrong it was could drive her away and that she would grow out of it given time anyway  He recognised it for the temporary infatuation it was  His actions were based on platonic love  he protected her feelings because he cared and didnt want to humiliate her

2015-05-06 20:29:18,2,0,2,Gett,More like movie guns are sometimes exactly like real guns they just fire blanks instead which can be still be dangerous It would be quite reckless to just hand one to a teenage actress and hope for the best so they probably thought it was prudent to teach her gun safety with actual guns along with the added benefit of getting some authenticity out of her shooting scenes during filming
2015-05-06 20:29:25,9,0,9,Gett,I may be wrong but isnt stunt casting when they hire big name actors to play small roles in order to generate interest in the movie Like getting Angelina Jolie to be the face on every poster and trailer for Sky Captain and World of Tomorrow when really she plays a really small role in the movie They didnt show any of Matt Damon in the trailersposters so he was a total surprise

2015-05-07 18:48:07,2,0,2,Gett,Thats true You typically see native 3D attempted by filmmakers who already have a lot of technical expertise and experience so conversion is getting a lot more use by Hollywood
2015-05-07 18:48:26,5,0,5,Gett,Honestly converted work has been getting better over the years I wasnt there when it was done but I hear horror stories of one of the first big conversion my company did The Last Airbender there was next to no control on what would have volume or not  But I would say the biggest boon that we have every received is actually getting proper assets for films we work on This allows us to fine tune the 3D and have good looking effects like transparent objects and smoke In the case of AoU we basically had the assets for all shots that had any sort of VFX on it We even had Depth pass renders of many objects like Ultron and Hulkbuster this allowed for having these characters to be very detailed in 3D

2015-05-07 20:11:39,4,0,4,Gett,It wont come close to the resolution of 1570mm film but maybe in the ballpark of 565mm film  The problem is playback  IMAX doesnt have a digital projection system capable of getting anywhere close to 1570 film  Their Xenon projectors are 22Ks layered on top of each other and their new Laser system is only 6K which is a huge improvement over the Xenons but nothing compared to the 18K resolution of film
2015-05-07 20:20:29,5,0,5,Gett,Stark isnt the villain by any capacity in Civil War hes just on the opposite side of Cap Stark is pushed to the side he is on because of guilt feeling he was responsible for a bunch of kids getting killed and this pushes him towards trying to do the right thing Captain America is the one on the wrong side of the law forced to take the Avengers Underground I doubt the movie will follow this canon to a tee but Tony Stark is nowhere close to a villain in Civil War

2015-05-07 20:53:49,1,0,1,Gett,And those cannot rightfully be called IMAX The whole purpose of IMAX is to give you an image thats so large it fills your whole field of vision and so sharp and highresolution that you think its real It literally means Image MAXimized If youre not getting a maximized image its not IMAX The only way to get that image is for the entire workflow from camera to projector to be done at extremely high resolution In other words IMAX is material that was shot on IMAX film in an IMAX camera and projected on an IMAX film projector Anything else is not real IMAX Shooting something on 35mm or 2k4k digital and transferring it to IMAX film and playing it on an IMAX projector does not make it IMAX as the source material is too low resolution A 2K or 4K digital projector or even a pair of them is not IMAX no matter what you play on it

2015-05-08 15:15:45,3,0,3,Gett,Its different than the first Avengers The first one is waferthin and fun mostly the novelty of seeing the characters together Ultron is getting them all together with an actual plot this time Its got a ton of parts moving and you need to just enjoy it and engage it for what it is and know things will make more sense on rewatch and in longer cuts on bluray
2015-05-08 15:16:48,0,0,0,Gett,So are we getting three Frontier set movies this year This one Leos and Mcconaugheys

2015-05-08 15:34:10,2,0,2,Gett,In Interstellar all the women kept getting older and Matthew McConaughey stayed the same age
2015-05-08 15:37:42,6,0,6,Gett,Quasimodo was also a deafmute and not even necessarily one of the main characters Gringoire was the ostensible protagonist with Clopin and Frollo also getting a lot of page time Frollo was more compelling in the book because he was way more troubled and nuanced Also Phoebus was a total dick
2015-05-08 15:37:57,-2,0,-2,Gett,Gotta be honest here  was an original Tarantino fanatic Jackie Brown an alltime favourite and then somewhere around halfway through Kill Bill I just realized this was getting annoying 20 minutes into Basterds and I realized I was well over Tarantino
2015-05-08 15:45:06,-1,0,-1,Gett,Not really It was a quickly forgettable film anyway Just a smashemup summer spectacular pure teenage boy entertainment and nothing more
2015-05-08 15:55:27,2,0,2,Gett,That was actually one of my favorite parts of Django And the way they backlit the people getting shot added to how rad it looked
2015-05-08 15:58:29,1,0,1,Gett,I dunno Tarantino is getting old to me I feel like I know exactly what to expect because its the same stuff I saw in DjangoInglorious BastardsKill Billetc Just the title The Hateful Eight makes me think more revengegun battleWestern70sstyle stuff
2015-05-08 16:05:22,0,0,0,Gett,Hum he wont win if his essay sucks Thats kind of the point of the essay contest There is nothing random about it the owner selects a winner based on essay  follow up interviews Idk where youre getting raffle from this isnt a random chance drawing If the owner wants to give his cinema to a shmuck I guess thats up to him but its more likely that hell select a dedicated smart person
2015-05-08 16:08:15,2,0,2,Gett,Are you implying consistently excellent directors making new movies arent worth getting pumped over

2015-05-08 17:05:56,6,0,6,Gett,You might know about this already but apparently Blacks scripts were ridiculously quirky I remember reading about how hed break the fourth wall in his screenplays For example hed describe a large and impressive mansion in order to set a scene and hed go on about how that would be the type of mansion hed buy if the script ended up getting bought Stuff like that
2015-05-08 17:13:12,1,0,1,Gett,Looks like a great cast Tarantino keeps getting better and better
2015-05-08 17:14:58,2,0,2,Gett,I was pretty disappointed with the movie especially after having gone to some trouble to track down the DVD this was a couple of years ago I thought the first person viewpoint got old pretty fast  it seemed the standard POV camera work except that the back of the dudes head kept getting in the way And as for zooming across the city from one scene to another  fine once or twice but after that just cut already Then  the big finale in the brothel  it was basically just people screwing with neon light effects coming out of their nether regions
2015-05-08 17:26:43,1,0,1,Gett,Some of my friends worked on it I am thrilled Colorado is getting more major films I run a film production company in BoulderDenver and it means that a lot of people are running to get on these productions and they send me their freelanced clients Keep bringing films to Colorado so I can keep stealing my friends clients

2015-05-08 18:50:49,3,0,3,Gett,This will kill it Terminator is suppose to be R granted blockbusters are getting better amp better with pushing the PG13 rating
2015-05-08 18:58:41,10,0,10,Gett,This deal is getting worse all the time
2015-05-08 19:09:17,-1,0,-1,Gett,What I find hilarious about this is unaddressed technical issues majorly impact the movie going experience Strange that people who give no shits about getting there moneys worth would even respond to this Either way OSHA has a section for employees forced to work in unsafe conditions which a hot booth and Arizona summer very much created with over 120 degree temps
2015-05-08 19:14:06,3,0,3,Gett,My wife saw it in theaters 2005 and hated it I keep getting her to try watching it with me but she refuses Fucking theater edit

2015-05-08 20:09:34,7,0,7,Gett,Huh I mean the first wasnt anything awful but definitely not something I saw getting a sequel
2015-05-08 20:28:12,1,0,1,Gett,Is it just me or is the Western making a strong comeback Maybe not in the mainstream but ive noticed a slew of fantastic westerns in the past few years and with Slow West and Hateful Eight coming it only seems to be getting better and better
2015-05-08 20:51:51,2,0,2,Gett,Its been a long time but I thought it was pretty clear he had been shot in the head in the robbery and seemed fine then died as everyone was getting to the car He was slumped over the wheel
2015-05-08 21:21:46,1,0,1,Gett,So who ended up being the actor that put Tarantino into a shit storm when this thing was getting off the ground
2015-05-08 21:34:13,30,0,30,Gett,5 out of 5 youre forgetting his work as Maggie Smith in Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire
2015-05-08 21:42:07,1,0,1,Gett,Its all over the walking dead which is understandable given budget but it ruins a lot of cool zombie kills  If you watch the gif of the three zombies getting their heads lopped half off its really REALLY obvious CGI
2015-05-08 21:48:57,2,0,2,Gett,Its a Civil War flick and stands up pretty well next to Gettysburg There are a couple of longwinded monologues from Jackson but its accurate to his reputation as a devout Christian Still a good film
2015-05-08 21:49:19,-4,0,-4,Gett,Will we see the pedophilia ring getting exposed
2015-05-08 22:13:38,2,0,2,Gett,Oh trust me this thing is getting like a 20 maybe even lower on Rotten Tomatoes as this film is looking to insult every critic who saw and loved the first 2 Terminator films so 80 of critics will pan the shit out of this turd and 20 will be either dumbbrainless or paid critics This film will be worse than Machines and Salvation as at least those 2 didnt really insult the franchise they were just very generic This films latest trailer pissed me off as a fan of the first 2 Terminator films
2015-05-08 22:29:52,4,0,4,Gett,I didnt work on this particular show but I do work on these kinds of projects I knew immediately how unappreciative that was going to sound to the VFX crews who spent years and probably worked 12s for a lot of that time getting the film out the door
2015-05-08 22:39:31,-1,0,-1,Gett,Exactly Its why I love Marvel People say their movies are getting stale but thats only for The Avengers movies which are still great All the individual movies try to adhere themselves to different subgenres Sort of how The Winter Soldier was a political espionage thriller with a superhero thrown in it Or GOTG was a spaceoperacomedy flick
2015-05-08 22:49:00,1,0,1,Gett,He slapped a cameraman getting a coffeehttpswwwyoutubecomwatchvBxYHxJahzmU He is cool as hell but hed probably troll you like this or be really cool depending on how you act like dont just film him when he says dont
2015-05-08 22:49:49,2,0,2,Gett,Noone wants to see a PG1312a Terminator film Theyve made less and less money every time theyve released a Terminator film rated 12 Its getting fucking ridiculous now
2015-05-08 22:53:38,1,0,1,Gett,I think A is definitely gonna happen I can just visualize it now Also an end joke about Gerard Butler getting on the left side of the car while theyre being chased by bad guys
2015-05-08 23:08:33,8,0,8,Gett,I wish Pacific Rim wasnt so forgettable
2015-05-08 23:14:08,2,0,2,Gett,i agree with it most of what you said but it will probably make a lot overseas compared to its competition Pitch Perfect and maybe AoU which seems to be declining quite fast Especially here in Australia where people are super pumped for this and not just middle aged people but also classmates and kids from schools as well It definetly wont do well in America but Overseas it might have a shot at getting 350400Mill
2015-05-08 23:31:19,1,0,1,Gett,Thats not the name of the character its the name of the actor and youre not even getting THAT right
2015-05-08 23:43:10,1,0,1,Gett,Yeah i really thought they were ending iron man at that point Like it would just be tony stark going to his normal billionaire life I thought he was moving on Now he is the sane person same powers just knowing he helped fuck over and harm alot of people The rings would have been so fucking cool to include Especially since now we are getting more into characters with magic and powersdoctor strange scarlet witch spiderman When they didnt include them it ruined the movie for me It really did They talked up how evil mandarin was how his rings worked and all that I thought marvel was taking a huge step forward and all the movie did was show that tony has ptsd
2015-05-09 00:24:09,1,0,1,Gett,Plus Miles getting shot in front of his kid that was a lot of blood
2015-05-09 00:41:32,2,0,2,Gett,Im curious as to if he does or not It was originally one before being split in two and hes screened the Whole Bloody Affair quite a few times speaking of which is that ever getting a BluRay release
2015-05-09 01:26:09,7,0,7,Gett,I dont get it either The dark Nolan films were great movies You can take an outthere concept and give it weight The Marvel filmsand especially Age of Ultron are getting increasingly forgettable for me because they dont have that weight You know nothings really at stake in the end except a minor character or two
2015-05-09 02:03:55,1,0,1,Gett,Finally getting around to The Professional this weekend
2015-05-09 02:43:49,2,0,2,Gett,I remember watching the Venom arc of that show and getting extremely pissed that the show created to make extra money off the movie did a better job of telling the story than the film could The whole subconscious battle for Peters body was fantastic storytelling
2015-05-09 02:45:18,4,0,4,Gett,It seems like you dont like the premise of the show The reviews are bookended with a sketch about two 4 sarcastic assholes who waste their time at work getting drunk and watching movies Its more of a comedy review show than a fair critique
2015-05-09 02:52:43,29,0,29,Gett,I loved reading Eberts reviews of classic movies as I started getting into film The perfect way he was able to convey his experience with a film often helped me understand my own experience better Thats the sign of a great critic
2015-05-09 02:59:05,3,0,3,Gett,Looks like he is indeed still getting headshots
2015-05-09 02:59:11,2,0,2,Gett,Here I was thinking it was going to be a tale of dying boy meets girl who helps him experience the world  Then it turned into Misery and just kept getting weirder  Needless to say Ill watch it
2015-05-09 03:06:39,4,0,4,Gett,Agreed  There are plenty of people doing dream things there are many references to alternate teams the scene where you see the burnouts httplh4ggphtcomTYf79ofm7rATg1TgzTGPrIAAAAAAAAAAAeQqOy_N1H8s800inceptionmoviepng shows you that it isnt a rare thing  Plus all the defense training that CEOs and such are getting is clearly a business
2015-05-09 03:15:26,1,0,1,Gett,There are definitely vids of that on the internet but for the sake of being classy not getting banned Ill leave the search up to you guys And I meant that tarantino has an inflated view of himself due to hipsters and their memetic love of him
2015-05-09 03:53:54,360,0,360,Gett,Yeah that bothered me even at 10 years old For people who dont know this there was supposed to be a scene showing velociraptors sneaking onto the ship which would perfectly explain the crew getting torn apart But for some inexplicable reason it was not carried through with just one of many many poor decisions they made for that film
2015-05-09 04:05:39,1,0,1,Gett,I know Its really getting weird
2015-05-09 04:06:51,4,0,4,Gett,Holy crap I just saw that yesterday and though I liked it it made me feel stupid for not getting what was going on Thanks for posting this
2015-05-09 04:15:39,1,0,1,Gett,I was getting choked out by my roommate from a wrestling match college is a weird time and he screamed Give up And I said Never I never save anything for the swim back My other roommate starts laughing his ass off Gattaca reference
2015-05-09 04:15:41,-2,0,-2,Gett,I hated this movie And it sucks that I cant share that opinion without getting a horde of downvotes Everyone should be able to have their own opinions
2015-05-09 04:58:07,2,0,2,Gett,To me at least the first two both had one standout scene Gollum  Bilbos initial encounter with Smaug before they start melting gold and getting silly The third one is I went into it expecting something horribly awful and it was pretty bad at some parts if you can turn your brain off a few of the fight scenes are fun and the madness of the Dwarf king is okay to watch So I was pleasantly surprised kind of
2015-05-09 05:09:11,31,0,31,Gett,Indeed Charlize getting killed by the ship is FAR less troubling for me than the cartographers
2015-05-09 05:16:56,3,0,3,Gett,definitely getting there but its a little more tempered than it is postinception
2015-05-09 05:20:18,2,0,2,Gett,Was this the one with Gerard Butler Or was that White house down I keep getting them confused
2015-05-09 05:50:24,1,0,1,Gett,That character flaws can be attributed to unexplained events is frankly implicit in the idea of a character law Why was the character flawed after all Because of an event that wasnt explained of course Its true that character flaws are in that sense just a subset of unexplained events but such there is also an important different of degree here Bruce Wayne getting from the middle east to the Atlantic seaboard in a couple of days is if seeming impractical at least plausible by reference to a series of events that are not extremely unlikely
2015-05-09 05:52:01,1,0,1,Gett,When Quentin Tarantion dies or stops making films Michael Madsen will stop getting work
2015-05-09 05:53:08,2,0,2,Gett,walking like a duck while chomping on his pipe Hes not on screen much but hes unforgettable
2015-05-09 06:11:35,5,0,5,Gett,Yup Disney arent fucking around with the new SW flicks They paid 4 billion for the fuckers so were getting a new SW movie every year for the foreseeable future
2015-05-09 06:26:53,4,0,4,Gett,Another possible explanation could be that people of altered timelines are always vaguely connected to the previous timeline If an effect of alteration is slow and creeping the new timeline would integrate without causing cognitive dissonance like friends sometimes grow apart without noticing and at one point practically forgot each other If on the other hand a person is not only getting a selective singular change presented to them but they were also prepared for it in the old timeline the dissonance would be too strong to ignore
2015-05-09 06:31:05,40,0,40,Gett,Amen  Bruce getting back to Gotham  Hes fucking batman AND Bruce Wayne
2015-05-09 06:36:05,1,0,1,Gett,I guess Did Maria Hill not get any of that foreshadowy dialogue Maria Hill keeps getting more screentime than maybe she should be getting
2015-05-09 06:42:15,23,0,23,Gett,No one said killing someone was hard Its getting away with killing someone is hard
2015-05-09 06:44:24,3,0,3,Gett,Thank you for this I was getting sick of seeing every single plot elements in popular films getting labeled as OMFG PLOT HOLE
2015-05-09 06:47:46,1,0,1,Gett,They know she died because her implants would alert the powers that be of that fact Getting rid of her body in the past would have led to too many people asking too many questions So they burned the body in the house to throw the track off the gat men and set up Joe
2015-05-09 06:50:17,54,0,54,Gett,So yeah I like FPSes Uh what can I say Theres nothing like the rush of huntin people down and killin em I mean my hearts beating my hearts beating My hands are shakin my hands are shakin But Im still shootin now screaming An Im still gettin headshots Its like boom Headshot Boom Headshot Boom Headshot
2015-05-09 06:56:41,2,0,2,Gett,Finally someone explaining that Bruce getting back into Gotham during TDKR wasnt a plot hole I feel like Ive explained why it isnt a billion times here and in real life Thank you
2015-05-09 07:12:06,3,0,3,Gett,I feel the same about Lynch Both seem to be getting into music though
2015-05-09 07:20:56,4,0,4,Gett,This was a great read I found it quite satisfying because it pissed me off hearing people say that Bruce Wayne getting back to Gotham is a huge plot hole and Im like no no its not Id like to hear your thoughts on whether this counts as a plot hole by your definition I would say it does Star Trek 2009 A Supernova is not a surprise it announces its arrival millions of years in advance There is no reason for all Romulans to die to a Supernova when primitive humans of the 21st century can already know when a star will die
2015-05-09 07:21:31,3,0,3,Gett,The character who represents mankind is called Dr Mann Gettit It took me a few viewings and a couple of interplanetary ventures to notice that crucial detail
2015-05-09 07:21:58,2,0,2,Gett,And he was getting scrubbed down from any radiation he might have endured
2015-05-09 07:27:23,112,0,112,Gett,They covered this in the film When the family is getting into the vans to go to the airport the telephone repairman comes up to Mrs McAllister and says something along the lines of Weve fixed the local lines but the long distance cables are a mess Its gonna take MaBell a few days to get this sorted out Mrs McAllister just says okay thanks and closes the van door
2015-05-09 07:44:04,4,0,4,Gett,I liked both but preferred OHF Lots of dudes getting shot in the head and Im about that life
2015-05-09 08:04:31,17,0,17,Gett,they clarify the character flaws in prometheus tho The dude specifically said he didnt get the best of the best he got the ones that were willing to do what the best would definitely not do And with that said its easier to accept that the characters were not meant to be without flaws I love that movie it gets a lot of flak for the characters but i just looked past that and accepted that they were renegade not very trained or prepared crew i get a weird satisfaction of  people overtly stupid getting killed Plus the visuals and all the shit in that movie was super interesting
2015-05-09 08:10:07,0,0,0,Gett,Was getting caught a part of his plan
2015-05-09 08:12:59,31,0,31,Gett,You know the one that always bothered me Final Destination 3 Theyre on a roller coaster pervy guy brings his camera on board tries getting some shots of roller coaster boobs drops the camera which wraps round a track and causes the coaster to derail Then the premonition kicks in and pervy guy gets off the coaster meaning theres no camera to cause the derailment Sure the ride was rickety beforehand but that was the key cause of the accident
2015-05-09 08:18:59,3,0,3,Gett,My assumption was that he was somehow setting up the meeting with Agent Smith like the Matrix version of text messaging and then after Neo leaves Cipher logs in normally to the Matrix to have the actual meeting  Thought about this way it is a bit of a Character Flaw as the risk of getting caught by the Crew seems very high  But then again Cipher was kind of an idiot anyways
2015-05-09 08:25:39,1,0,1,Gett,Ah Now were finally getting somewhere
2015-05-09 08:29:24,0,0,0,Gett,Its a plothole but its intentional  Its a plot hole because it is an example of the grandfather paradox  Its intentional because time travel and manipulation of time are main themes in the story  A plothole can itself be a plot device in the hands of a skilled writer  For examplevisible brush strokes are the sign of a bad painter when they are made unintentionally  They show the painters lack of skill  And yet Monets painting style was based on them So why is he famous  Because Monet was perfectly capable of painting without visible brush strokes  He chose not to  They were intentional and hence represent a stylistic choicenot a lack of skill  The same is true of plot holes  When they are created unintentionally they are the technical errorlike forgetting to properly season a dish or breaking a poached egg are technical errors in cooking  When it is done intentionally as part of a storys plotas part of its major themes or to drive the story by jarring the audiencethen they are not errors they are stylistic choices
2015-05-09 08:56:24,1,0,1,Gett,It came about because one of the earlier trailers had a quick clip of the city getting destroyed and you barely hear a guy say its alive but with everything going on in the scene it sounds like its a lion
2015-05-09 09:03:37,2,0,2,Gett,With the geologist getting lost that would just come under the category of unexplained event its not at all impossible that something happened that lead to an inability to read the maps or something
2015-05-09 09:16:50,16,0,16,Gett,Its such a forgettable movie As boring as Clooneys Leatherheads
2015-05-09 09:46:14,8,0,8,Gett,But realize that being spatially unaware of where you are can be enough to get lost Even if you have a map you still need a reference point Just because the ship has a sweet 3d hologram tracker doesnt mean the team does so the dude who threw out some trackers getting lost is by no means implausible
2015-05-09 09:46:32,1,0,1,Gett,Thats the point though of what I said By that point in the movie we were getting day to day progress of the Gotham take over Then suddenly supposedly weeks or months go by and the transition did not reflect that well It gave a weird he went around the block to go home feeling through a time portal The trilogy has never really done that at least unexpectedly towards the denmoeunt
2015-05-09 10:03:00,8,0,8,Gett,Where are you getting that people dont like him I have heard nothing but good things about his films Different tone from previous bonds but still great films
2015-05-09 10:17:14,1,0,1,Gett,Daniel Craig is quite beloved Im not sure where youre getting this notion that people dislike him There were and are I suppose a sizeable contingent of people who think hes physically miscast  too short too blond too ugly too thuggish etc  and that sentiment is perfectly justified when hes compared against Flemings Bond
2015-05-09 10:30:19,18,0,18,Gett,Dont worry Well still be getting Crash and Eddie spinoff films for years to come The Ice Age cinematic universe is alive and well
2015-05-09 11:08:05,22,0,22,Gett,Thats right The whole plot of the movie is him repeatedly going back in time and changing small things which then changes the future in massive ways which is why the film is called The Butterfly Effect Like hell go back and stop his friend from getting in an accident Then he returns to the present and everyones lives are utterly different because of that one small change This happens multiple times and is the whole premise and plot and title of the movie
2015-05-09 11:09:11,23,0,23,Gett,OH MAN look into getting the Agent9 Fanedit of Prometheus I cant recommend it enough 100 times better It pretty much fixed the questionable parts and is highly watchable Let me explain what Agent9 did He took out all the stupidoverglorifiedshock value scenes Put in the viral Weyland TedTalk scene put in a number of deleted scenes AND completed the unfinished CGI on them And overall fixed Prometheus Its quite good really
2015-05-09 11:59:06,30,0,30,Gett,He saves his girlfriend with web forgetting that momentum is still in effect and her neck snaps from the whiplash
2015-05-09 12:09:04,5,0,5,Gett,I mostly enjoyed the movie but Ultron completely lost any menace he had when he started cracking wise and humorously forgetting words

2015-05-09 13:21:17,2,0,2,Gett,I always assumed that because of magic the adults have false memories of getting the presents themselves Maybe Santa doesnt want to be known by adults and after the big reveal at the end of the movie the adults go back to not believing

2015-05-09 16:15:17,1,0,1,Gett,Thanks for the reply Well I hope they were talking about an early edit then I do seem to recall there were hours of footage that didnt end up getting used and earlier edits were probably very different
2015-05-09 16:21:55,2,0,2,Gett,Well they werent getting the message Obviously Kevin had to resort to even more violent tactics
2015-05-09 16:38:16,1,0,1,Gett,My interpretation of that scene was Cypher was setting up the loading program and waiting until everyone is sleeping or otherwise occupied before plugging himself in Hes probably done it many times before for recreation such as the lady in red program Neo walked up to him as he was getting things ready and startled him
2015-05-09 16:39:17,1,0,1,Gett,Except they did bring it up You shoot someones limbs off they disappear in the future but didnt stop that person from getting to where they are in the present Why did whats his face kill himself instead of simply shooting his hand off to prevent his future self from using a gun Its so stupid

2015-05-09 17:32:46,1,0,1,Gett,I dont really let things like that bug me too much i just put it together in my head maybe his leg is bad from long inactivity or maybe because he fell a few stories after confronting Two Face I think his emotional dilemma was the fact that he wasnt able to save Harvey and Rachel in the last movie which depressed him to the point where he ruined his own reputation just to give up crime fighting in order to prevent more people from getting killed

2015-05-09 17:48:48,3,0,3,Gett,I feel like Chappie got overhated I went to the cheap seats like a month ago to watch it and it wasnt that bad It was cheesy predictable and definitely inferior to District 9 But as a big fan of Die Antwoord I had a blast watching the movie Underneath the thinly veiled themes I found the movie to be a very hopeful and less pretentious scifi compared to Interstellar Chappie is a movie I thoroughly enjoyed and can see it getting some cult following Especially with its whole science vs religion motif

2015-05-09 18:30:09,2,0,2,Gett,Thanks And to be sure this is totally a to each their own thing I can absolutely see what people liked about GotG Inception Skyfall etc I have the unfortunate burden of being a fiction writer myself though so my standards are way way too high And tastewise I prefer the grounded and dark and gritty and morally compromising sort of interrogation of the human condition as compared to overthetop flighty escapism from reality that pits moralistic absolutes against one another Good vs Evil as a reflection of reality probably never existed but it certainly stopped being culturally relevant after WWII but we seem to be hungup as a society about getting past that fucking period and embracing the world for the complicated place that it is
2015-05-09 18:31:52,7,0,7,Gett,gt No franchises fan base grades on a more generous curve than Marvelmovie aficionados or awards as many As for effort and intention Captain America The Winter Soldier books Robert Redford as the heavy and makes a few halfhearted allusions to our own imperiled civil liberties and everyone calls it a 70s political thriller with a straight face forgetting that actual 70s political thrillers seldom excused government malfeasance by blaming it on defrosted Nazi agents
2015-05-09 18:54:04,3,0,3,Gett,Luckily there are already a lot of ensemble tough guy movies from the 60s The Great Escape The Magnificent SevenSeven Samurai The Guns of Navarone The Dirty Dozen Ice Station Zebra probably a shit ton more Im forgetting about I remember my Dad used to talk wearily about these kind of films the way some people do about superhero movies today they were practically everywhere

2015-05-09 19:46:29,1,0,1,Gett,Not all continuity errors are the mistake of the script supervisor since the script supervisor is not allowed to go and act the scene for the actor  Sometimes actors decide they want to do something entirely different after a scene has already begun getting shot then in the editing room the editor intercuts between two takes of two shots that include the actor performing different actions ie holding a different object  The script supervisor can always say Hey guys now we need to go back and reshoot these lines of dialogue and these camera angles with the new action effectively pushing our shooting schedule back by an hour to two hours or even half a day but that will likely not be acceptable  Nor is a script supervisor telling Brad Pitt Okay now do it again but with a glass in your hand while were an hour and a half behind schedule a sure solution  But part of the script supervisors job is being a scapegoat for every mistake of a film from scheduling to continuity to performances to poor camera placement  So carry on

2015-05-09 20:54:37,1,0,1,Gett,I kinda feel bad for Jackson because hes clearly a true geek and a Tolkien fan but was put in a difficult position where the studio wouldnt fund the films unless they were stretched out to a trilogy to make the same  as LOTR and if he didnt direct them someone else who might not have cared as much about the material would have Plus Ian McKellan is getting up there and it was probably  now or never for him to play Gandalf again
2015-05-09 21:10:15,2,0,2,Gett,There is a big difference between a plot hole and shoddy story telling Showing James Bond talking to M and getting a mission and then him having sex with the pretty girl while the bad guy gets arrested isnt a plot hole its a shitty movie
2015-05-09 21:14:27,1,0,1,Gett,Yeah man I love the dude but all he had to work with was ham for Ronan and sometime after 14 I stopped getting behind onedimensional villains who aspired to be mass murderers for petty and immature reasons that yield no endgame Such a shame Marvel wasted him on that throwaway role

2015-05-09 21:28:08,0,0,0,Gett,That movie is basically just a two hour compilation of chase scenes Having not seen it since theaters I can recall foot car motorcycle speedboat tied to a rope plane helicopter and running over exploding building chases Im probably forgetting some Its just boring
2015-05-09 21:28:46,6,0,6,Gett,Im really curious why this movie is getting so much mediocre I guess that is the right word responses from critics I liked this one way more than the first Avengers mostly because I think Ultron is a much more relatable character then Loki was Could it be because critics are trying to get off of the Marvel hype train
2015-05-09 21:31:18,1,0,1,Gett,Horrors and thrillers Im currently in the middle of writing a Cronenbergesque horror with a friend and we are already getting interests in it from various groups for funding

2015-05-09 22:53:50,1,0,1,Gett,The issue I see with him actually plugging in to the matrix is that getting out requires the help of an operator like Tank

2015-05-09 23:36:38,31,0,31,Gett,I dont think I minded Toy Story getting sequels as much because it was kind of the hallmark Pixar film Otherwise I think they had been perfectly suited in their role of not doing sequels
2015-05-09 23:44:25,-3,0,-3,Gett,Pixar just lost my vote Being high and mighty about one form of animation when youre getting a renderfarm to do all your colouring in just doesnt wash with me

2015-05-10 00:12:00,1,0,1,Gett,And I wont argue  there is somewhat of a problem with that It kind of takes you out of the experience if you see countless baddies getting mowed down with bullets or whatever and not a single drop of blood in sight It really dehumanizes the whole thing well its okay to kill them they didnt even bleed Which amazes me seeing as how  two decades ago  we were so busy blaming Hollywood action movies for what was wrong with America that we went and made it so much easier to justify mindlessly slaughtering people for the sake of slaughtering them on film without lending some sort of reality to the situation we were watching
2015-05-10 00:21:46,2,0,2,Gett,Im getting to go on wednesday for a special screening and all I have to do is show up in post apocalypse looking gear Cant wait
2015-05-10 00:38:52,2,0,2,Gett,It would be the Clooney getting top billing just like in the Oceans 11 movies  He would get the most money probably a share of the profits  Affleck would play the frustrated new batman who doesnt get as many people queuing as the Clooney  Bale would play the serious actor who hates conventions and fans but was contractually forced into showing up  Val Kilmer plays a crazy person who is there in disguise and is killing off batman fans who didnt like his interpretation of the character
2015-05-10 00:44:58,2,0,2,Gett,I agree  As Chaplin who made this scene to stand up to the propagandist techniques employed in Triumph of the Will which repulsed him wanted to show the power of a sincere human voice and an open empathetic face in touching the hearts of an audience and as one of those elements his terrific face has been removed in this video I almost didnt bother with this bitching  Its just that and Im not exaggerating the last eight times Ive seen this speech praised there has been a link to a clip of this scene that has had some new soundtrack added and there are many different updatings all of them crappy  Sorry for gettin preachy  Thanks for the upload

2015-05-10 02:16:30,0,0,0,Gett,I thought he made a good point Maybe those people were supposed to die From a Christian standpoint which I believe the movie was getting at Gods plan if you will If Clark goes around saving every airliner about to crash or every building about to fall this would be an interference in that plan There might be a reason their lives were supposed to end there So I think maybe was a good answer
2015-05-10 02:16:36,2,0,2,Gett,Sorry youre getting downvoted  I too thought the soundtrack was beautiful
2015-05-10 02:18:32,1,0,1,Gett,I think youre missing the essence of the argument Noones saying that Happy Feet is a betterworse movie or expression of art than Cars Theyre just saying it wasnt fully animated Happy Feet utilized motion capture to avert the difficulties in animating human motion and was awarded Best Animated Feature despite not being fully animated It would be like an artist getting an award for best painting when he just printedoff and pastedon the most difficulthuman parts of the image and then painted around them

2015-05-10 04:55:12,3,0,3,Gett,Wow thanks for the quick reply after 129 days lol Yeah I agree but I still found the ending believable and effective and it even made me cry which is rare for horror movies although I cry at drama films often I was actually thinking what could they do to make sure its real It was confusing how they even kept getting separated I was thinking just keep shouting for each other and maybe hold hands But the girl deffo didnt know as much as it first appeared as she was only like 11 and had very little information if she did maybe night vision googles would have worked Imagine how creepy it would be if they stopped working and she was dumped into darkness though

2015-05-10 09:04:37,-2,0,-2,Gett,Eh  The Incredibles is Brads weakest film in my opinion  Course that may be because I just really hate anything superhero related  This trend of 30000 new superhero movies and tv shows per year is getting really fucking old  They just lack depth a lot of style and action over substance and theyre soooo overdone by now  It didnt help that the villains motivation was forced and silly the scenes in the city felt drab and empty and it was almost disturbing how much pleasure Dash took in watching those henchmen fucking explode

2015-05-11 00:03:29,2,0,2,Gett,The ending is pretty much what made the movie so highly acclaimed and why everyone likes it so much I personally think its an amazing movie and the ending I get your point but at the same time you gotta understand were talking about a guy here who was locked up for 10 or 15 years the dude is bat shit insane and you gotta keep that in mind at all times just like its weird the first time he meets the girl He pretty much had no purpose in life other than getting revenge up until he finds out at the very end that theres still someone he cares about so on top of that crazy shit of his hes trying to protect the only good thing he has left and hes also dealing with some other repressed psycho

2015-05-11 21:12:21,5,0,5,Gett,I think youre missing the point a bit there  Its well known that Rrated movies arent typically making as much money as PG13 or lower these days so its getting harder and harder for filmmakers to put out anything R  And yes you can point to R rated movies being released all day long but that doesnt change the fact that this is the trend overall and its resulted in a lot of tepid action and horror releases over the past decade or so  Compare the PG13 version of Stay Alive to the R rated version for instance  Nearly totally different movies  The studio made them reshoot nearly 30 minutes of footage for the theatrical version when they cut it down to PG13
2015-05-11 21:13:23,2,0,2,Gett,This is going to be one of the times where I disagree with the filmmaker One of my favorite things about studying at film school was getting to speak to filmmakers about their work and hearing their interpretations of their own work On this one I thought this was the ending that showed people are complex creatures and she grasped the complexity Did she do something most people would do or is she just acting on the manipulation that Caleb and Nathan kept showing Do we even understand human nature When she leaves it made my friend and I feel like she acted on her AI rather than a conscience so it made us start asking these questions Honestly if she was doing it as a way of selfpreservation then that makes things all the more confusing since Caleb would have clearly let her go But maybe she didnt think so since he hesitated when she was asking him if they could live together out there The writing is so complex and brilliant Im glad to see someone else with a love for Garland

2015-05-11 23:35:43,10,0,10,Gett,Its pretty much full on rape Theres no getting around it Im not sure how that was even appropriate for its time
2015-05-11 23:42:06,1,0,1,Gett,He was pretty consistent up until the latest one when they changed the voice actor He always felt like the same character from the first game till Conviction he was always getting older is all
2015-05-11 23:44:42,2,0,2,Gett,Well Im glad to hear its getting good reviews  Honestly from watching the previews I couldnt tell if it was going to be good or just bunch of explosions throwing bodiesmajesticallyaround
2015-05-11 23:47:48,12,0,12,Gett,Forgetting Sarah Marshall had a couple of moments like this for me Maybe it was just the point I was at in my life but some things hit hard
2015-05-11 23:49:23,1,0,1,Gett,We are getting all these new marvel movies just to lead up to a shot of every living hero and possibly villain about to take on thanos We know this why else would half these characters get a movie Unless they are just finding infinity stones

2015-05-12 00:13:02,15,0,15,Gett,As someone who lived in Hawaii for many years almost every movie ever made in the South Pacific is deeply insulting to Pacific Islanders even to the present day  Theyre either filled with really insulting stereotypes the original King Kong Blue Hawaii Joe vs the Volcano or whitewash the shit out of things  In fact about the only Hollywood movies that Im familiar with that didnt take a massive shit on the region are Forgetting Sarah Marshall and The Descendants and between those two The Descendants is the only one that really portrays the culture of the islands well Forgetting Sarah Marshall is mostly just an accurate portrayal of what its like to take a vacation out there
2015-05-12 00:13:19,2,0,2,Gett,Pete Townshend had a hand in getting this movie madeI wish some of his music was in itThe lron man album is greatCheck out

2015-05-12 00:55:04,1,0,1,Gett,We have no idea how its going to go  however this is a thread about Thanos and potential problems with him  This is the potential problem that I fear most as it is the kind of lazy writing that I would have trouble getting past  I dont really care what possible explanations there are because it hasnt happened yet and it is amusingirritating how many people feel the need to explain the why of it when we dont know why at all  No bringing the comics into it is irrelevant because if you can only get the movies by knowing about the comics then the movies have failed
2015-05-12 01:15:41,2,0,2,Gett,Wars in the past but I started getting into Trek more and more I enjoy Trek now and have for the past decade or so now

2015-05-12 02:38:57,6,0,6,Gett,ATONEMENT Ok maybe not a bad film but it was a great story without a middle I was getting bored until that twist came at the end and completely blew me away Might be my favorite ending of all time

2015-05-12 04:06:26,1,0,1,Gett,The film brings up many interesting ideas and questions and then the director does what he does everytime he answers these questions with the characters simply killing each other 28 Days Later the characters end the film by all killing each other Sunshine the characters end up getting killed and or killing people this the same thing
2015-05-12 04:07:15,2,0,2,Gett,Both the second and third time I watched it I forgot the ending and wanted to kick my own ass for forgetting and letting myself watch it again
2015-05-12 04:21:00,1,0,1,Gett,im sick and tired of all the hate this film is getting The reason Doom is not a gypsy is because its Ultimate Doom from Ultimate Fantastic foir where he was Victor Van Damme and he was just as brilliant as Reed and he fucked up a calculation causing him and the f4 to get powers this doom was a metal creature Thats what they are doing in the movie EVERYTHING YOU FANBOY ASSHOLES HAVE A PROBLEM WITH IS COMIC BOOK CANON TO ULTIMATE F4 EXCEPT FOR BLACK JOHNNY Oh and hes probably not a blogger because why the bloody hell would they take a blogger on an interdimensional expedition

2015-05-12 05:04:20,0,0,0,Gett,People in the theater applauded the shooting of the sniper People wrote articles on how this movie showed the truth of war when it turned almost all Iraqis in to evil stereotypes It also had the sniper fighting in conflicts both for the Sunnis and the Shias It tied 911 to the Iraq war He blamed his fellow solider for getting killed in an ambush and nobody called him out on it
2015-05-12 05:06:20,2,0,2,Gett,I think it was because Sherlock Holmes was bigger than expected Ritchie was getting alot more Hollywood and bigger profile offers Either way Rocknrolla was my favorite or Ritchies films so I hope one day it will happen Seemed like it would be a cool series but then again Ritchie has never done edit as in written a sequel

2015-05-12 06:23:42,4,0,4,Gett,no holes here we can have an adult conversation no downvoting or mocking you for you taste I respect that you enjoyed the movie I just didnt and my strong feelings about it are probably more to do with the fact that MacFarlane keeps getting money to make these shitty projects If it was a comedy without him I still would have disliked it but just would probably have forgotten it existed by now
2015-05-12 06:31:49,2,0,2,Gett,I remember getting The Guest in the mail from netflix and from the first thirty minutes expected some sort of family drama Holy heck was I pleasantly surprised in how it turned out
2015-05-12 10:36:54,1,0,1,Gett,Forgettable is right on the mark Ive seen the movie and could not tell you which of the generic horror plots it applies to
2015-05-12 10:39:23,1,0,1,Gett,Well getting historical details right can lend to authenticity For example for anyone with the least grasp on history may find Kingdom of Heaven insulting no matter how hard they try to suspend disbelief
2015-05-12 10:40:23,2,0,2,Gett,Thanks for posting this but before reading I just wanted to ask does anyone know if I need to see the first three films to understand fury road Ive never taken an interest in the series before but I just cant ignore the reviews fury road has been getting
2015-05-12 10:40:47,5,0,5,Gett,What did he give up Im normally pretty ready to hit close as soon as too much is getting revealed but almost everything was in the first trailer The only thing he kind of spoiled near the end of the review wasnt too bad
2015-05-12 10:59:08,4,0,4,Gett,I like Tom Hardy a lot but Im getting a little tired of the same faces popping up everywhere Marvel is probably guiltier of this at the moment  Paul Rudd Benedict Cumberbatch etc

2015-05-12 12:27:26,1,0,1,Gett,Dude youre still not getting it  You dont think its hard to be smarter than a con man  Good for you  Maybe you really are as smart as you think you are and you will never fall for any kind of fraud in your life  Maybe youre not as smart as you think you are but youre lucky enough to never be targeted by a great con artist  Good for you  None of that matters at all to the actual ethical point that just because someone has an advantage over someone else it does not give them the right to exploit that advantage for personal gain nor is it right to blame the victim for giving up that advantage  Unless you are literally the strongest and smartest person in the world someone out there will have the ability to exploit you in some way  Is that your fault for being exploitable  If so then literally every victim of every crime ever is at fault for not being literally the smartest and strongest person in the world
2015-05-12 12:39:38,2,0,2,Gett,I always read about QoS getting a lot of hate but I actually enjoyed it I will have to rewatch it soon and pay closer attention to the details during the opening title sequence

2015-05-12 13:06:30,4,0,4,Gett,Dont know why youre getting downvoted Its true and about the only accurate bit of the movie
2015-05-12 13:07:07,8,0,8,Gett,Thats Clint Eastwoods shooting style and I think his eye is starting to fail him Theres a lot of benefits of reshooting a scenelike saygetting an actual baby in the scene

2015-05-12 14:02:47,-6,0,-6,Gett,Yea but even if he says that there was no real substance to his arguments Im sure it is hard to review a movie without getting into huge spoilers but still it should be possible to state good arguments as to why you like it or not He on the other hand was just talking mostly random gibberish

2015-05-12 14:58:02,3,0,3,Gett,Yes I saw that and it made no sense in the context of the film Ultron had spent the previous 2 hours showing no connection to Thanos then one line at the very end hints that there might have been a connection all along Its hardly conclusive You are getting a lot from 5 words

2015-05-12 15:30:49,4,0,4,Gett,IM SO EXCITED FOR FURY ROAD  Ive been raving about it for months to my friends who havent watched any of the originals and they dismissed it as bland action  Now that its getting critical acclaim they are excited too and I have a 247 smug grin on my face  I CANT WAIT UNTIL FRIDAY APSIDPAOSDJPOADS

2015-05-12 16:56:34,6,0,6,Gett,This is getting far too explanatory for what was basically a joke about Giacchino puns and the tone of Marvels films However Tykwer has composed all the music for his films along with Reinhold Heil and Johnny Klimek since before Run Lola Run
2015-05-12 17:16:19,53,0,53,Gett,I agree but one thing about PG13 movies that bothers me is when people get killed by getting shot or cut then they pan over the bodies and there is no blood Kinda takes me out of the immersion
2015-05-12 17:16:39,1,0,1,Gett,Yeah I am going to check out the movie and have higher expectations but when he started getting excited it was nails on a chalkboard  Had to close it

2015-05-12 17:39:53,7,0,7,Gett,Ya i know which pisses me tf off I mean it was really false advertising on Marvels part making Ultron menacing and making movies tone darker in trailers I was expecting a movie like Winter Soldier and i was really disappointed If i knew i was getting Disney Ultron i would have different expectations which would be those one lines movie being all about fun and no consequences Hell i would expect 1 or 2 disney song too while were at it It wouldnt be bad and wouldnt be disappointing I would still see that movie
2015-05-12 17:41:29,4,0,4,Gett,Getting away from the same formula  interesting

2015-05-12 17:43:46,5,0,5,Gett,I also dont really get the joke if saving a few dozen people out of thousands In Avengers 2 most of the final act was composed of mounting a huge evacuation movement while keeping Ultron at bay getting everyone out of the city Cap even states that he wont let the Avengers leave anyone to die They only left to defend the trigger once Nick Fury had the civilians on the air carrier
2015-05-12 17:45:19,11,0,11,Gett,Possibly Tony Shalhoubs character makes more sense when you realize hes supposed to be getting high all the time They obviously cut out all the times he smoked up

2015-05-12 17:49:42,2,0,2,Gett,This comes up every so often but really the entertainment industry is the best industry to work in by far  So if one person who probably made a bunch on the front end thinks they got screwed by not getting a back end and all the crew actually made good money Im not shedding any tears  Yes Im a crew member for the last 20 years
2015-05-12 17:53:37,1,0,1,Gett,honestly Ive been waiting for this movie since I saw the road warrior when I was 14 22 now and its seriously the only franchise that exists that I always thought deserved a reboot Its the same director as the originals and its apparently his true vision I want as many people to see this movie as possible because its pretty much the only franchise that I want as many sequels as possible and George Miller isnt getting any younger He turned 70 while directing this
2015-05-12 17:58:38,-2,0,-2,Gett,Thats what whedon does when its getting too dark or serious he makes them have little quips to give them personality and draw back the bleakness Kind of like a ginger palette cleanser when eating sushi
2015-05-12 18:02:47,49,0,49,Gett,The movie wasnt being literal how are people not getting that
2015-05-12 18:13:44,11,0,11,Gett,Cap 2 was a good example of a movie with a more serious tone It still had quips and one liners it still had light moments but it took itself and the bad guys seriously It also showed Cap struggling getting hurt I think more MCU movies should be made like that
2015-05-12 18:24:19,12,0,12,Gett,NOt sure they needed to show him getting high he was obviously stoned out of his mind the whole time  Loved his character
2015-05-12 18:28:33,1,0,1,Gett,Haha OPs post is already getting down voted because people are talking about Mad Max to much Even if your on a more cinephile oriented sub reddit is essentially a good place for movie news and nothing else Its so frustrating
2015-05-12 18:32:51,4,0,4,Gett,Being a marvel fan Im honestly glad the avengers AOU is getting this kind of criticism I personally enjoyed the movie however there is no doubt it was rushed probably because Disney executives wanted it to fill a certain time quota and had too many unnesacary lighthearted jokes and quips where whedon is partly to blame for that as that is his style It just didnt work as well for the darker tone  that was set in the previous trailers If Feige wants a more lighthearted MCU the Fine just dont portray a movie as being darker then what it really is and you wont have those complaints A similar thing happened with iron man 3

2015-05-12 19:27:26,-4,0,-4,Gett,That movie sucked a big one It starts off fairly well GREAT opening scene but once they start running away from the city it turns into a generic spooky monster movie Group of people on the run slowly getting picked off one by one It lacked any of the subtleties concepts or messages 28 Days Later had It had nothing to do with the difference between the infected and man it was just Oh no monsters run away
2015-05-12 19:38:01,1,0,1,Gett,Haha thanks I actually have had them all downloaded on my harddrive for a while Theyve been on my list I plan on getting a crew together to watch them before seeing Fury Road
2015-05-12 19:40:55,3,0,3,Gett,As much as I dislike the film I LOVE the opening scene The reveal when they open the door for the kid was just so well done I was in absolute shock The entire following sequence of getting to the boat is also shot well and pretty captivating
2015-05-12 19:56:09,-2,0,-2,Gett,I agree with the first part Superman had no choice but to fight in Metropolis and Zod had no reason to follow him anymore like when he wanted the Codex But I disagree with the second part Zod was after Superman in that final battle until the very end when he started attacking civilians I think they could have shown more of Supermans goodnatured heroism while also getting across that he needs to focus on Zod if they had even one scene in the final battle of him trying to save people and Zod taking advantage of it by getting in a cheap shot But that never happens Superman saves Lois and no one stops him then he fights Zod Then they cut to the next scene Did Superman just fly away from the city too emotionally wrecked to help That would be understandable I mean he just saved a family and really the world but we needed to be shown something like that Some reason why he doesnt even try Instead it just looks like he doesnt even notice the destruction
2015-05-12 19:57:45,1,0,1,Gett,Yeah And oddly enough I only saw the movie because of all the positive praise it was getting from this very sub Now everybody here hates it Oh reddit you fickle beast You clearly dont know what you want
2015-05-12 20:06:17,1,0,1,Gett,Theres still an element to DD which makes it seem darker You had people at least three I can recall committing suicide out of fear and desperation You had innocent people getting their brains blown out just as collateral Daredevil himself was severely injuring and hospitalizing criminals It just felt more visceral and real than the conflicts in TDK which were indeed dark but still bordered on the fantastical
2015-05-12 20:18:49,1,0,1,Gett,Yeah when I saw it I was laying in my bed around 3am Had no idea what I was getting into just that it was about drugs

2015-05-12 20:43:19,61,0,61,Gett,This was the film that misguided poster should have been urging people to see if they want to support adult scifi themed films instead of needsnohelp Mad Max Fury Road which might actually stop Age of Ultron from getting a 3rd No 1 this weekend
2015-05-12 20:51:28,4,0,4,Gett,It got the audience laughing but when they were perfectly synchronized and Isaac started getting more angry and hostile it definitely started to make everyone uncomfortable in the best way Great multilayered scene

2015-05-12 23:10:12,3,0,3,Gett,Yeah well I think the implication there is that theres some kind of chance of resistance or something like that from the gene that causes the heterochromatism or whatever it is  Its been a long time since I saw 28 Weeks but Im pretty sure that was what they were getting at with the eye closeups and the chopper crash at the end and shit Its like the little kid is supposed to just be a carrier or something but they never really clarify exactly what they intended its all nebulous and oooooo spooky Guess well see what they were going for with the next one
2015-05-12 23:12:02,6,0,6,Gett,I think in the case of Cabin in the Woods one of the companys related tot he movies production went backrupt so it sort of got lost in the mess and wasnt able to be distributed until 2 years after the bankruptcy But I imagine theres a multitude of ways something can get dropped as I believe the entertainment industry in general has some high turnover at executive levels whenever things flop and that can mean that whoever once was pushing for a movie ends up getting pushed out
2015-05-12 23:13:04,1,0,1,Gett,Maybe bowman is a representation of humanity as a whole going through its transformation and hal represents the old way of self preservation So bowman destroying hal would be a representation of compassion destroying selfishness This is getting pretty far out I have only seen the film once and it was a while ago Ill go watch it again and see what my take on it is afterwards

2015-05-12 23:50:47,16,0,16,Gett,For me its a case of a great series going on waaaay to long The jokes start to get repetitive I love seasons 13 but after that I found myself forgetting to watch

2015-05-13 00:07:45,2,0,2,Gett,Distribution hell could literally be anything from a company owning the rights to distribute and then deciding to shelve because they cant find an appropriate window think of a horror movie and if a company has multiple films in the same genre they wont put them out at the same time as it would hurt their box office sales but they also recognize their competition so they have to wait for the right time And you can only release a horror film successfully at certain times in the year unless it makes sense eg a Christmas horror film in the winter to something like the film kept getting optioned and looked at by distributors and no one wanted to buy it Then it just got lost in the shuffle Making a film is difficult but really its obviously only half the battle Add to this that it was 2001 prior to all the digital distribution options filmmakers have today Im not surprised something like this wasnt distributed The creator most likely invested too much financially and emotionally to sell it at something less than they thought it was worth Considering the C list actors in it they most likely assumed it would at least break even in a distribution sale

2015-05-13 02:41:32,1,0,1,Gett,No one likes everything they see Keep exploring some of those unfamiliar genres and youll work out what you like in them and what you dont As much as I love seeing that great 1010 movie you have to find the fun in the search Dont waste energy hating what you dont like and getting frustrated or upset compare it to the one you did like think about why you responded one way to one and another to the other The more you know about yourself as a filmgoer the better youll be able to find movies that youll enjoy and even when you watch a movie you dont like it can still be a valuable and rewarding experience
2015-05-13 02:44:26,4,0,4,Gett,Cant say I expected the no substance criticism The film was more about the unavoidable questions brought about from the creation of AI rather than getting you deeply involved in the Nathan or Caleb characters

2015-05-13 05:31:09,2,0,2,Gett,Pretty much this but were getting closer to it being possible In fact Before Star Wars was sold to Disney Lucas was developing a live action show called UnderworldhttpstarwarswikiacomwikiStar_Wars_Underworld that was put on hold due to budget constraints Apparently they got pretty far though with more than 50 scripts written I think theres a good chance of starting this up again after The Force Awakens recaptures the publics interest though maybe Disney would want to use a different story Whats encouraging though is that Disney has a lot more resources than Lucasfilm which was an independent studio before

2015-05-15 00:26:30,2,0,2,Gett,I think its because Nolan manages to fall right in between being an action director and art director  So if you only hit the summer action movies than a Nolan Inception or TDK movie will be the one you see that is raved about and constantly talked about it  Because its probably going to be a degree more interesting despite all its flaws than the majority of whatever else was released And if you dont like it then it feels like your own tastes are getting called out as less refined
2015-05-15 00:31:02,2,0,2,Gett,I dont really see anything particularly out of the ordinary or anything glaring that sets him apart from the other top critics Doesnt seem to be an extremely compelling writer but I dont see what youre getting at
2015-05-15 00:33:56,29,0,29,Gett,I personally dont find it forgettable but a lot of people think that of alien 3 however the scene with the alien right up in Ripley face is one of the most iconic of the franchise despite the usual negative opinion people have of the movie
2015-05-15 00:41:37,1,0,1,Gett,Was there that much of a complaint before it came out though  It sucks that he ended up getting pressured into making something he wasnt fully inspired with
2015-05-15 00:44:29,1,0,1,Gett,So do you think well be getting a remake of Planet of the Apes and the subsequent sequels after this
2015-05-15 00:55:53,16,0,16,Gett,I didnt personally find it forgettable but Bourne Legacy the MKultra laboratory shooting scene is dark suspenseful and actually kind of scary
2015-05-15 01:00:03,-2,0,-2,Gett,Be content with the fact that youre getting another Super Troopers and move on
2015-05-15 01:01:58,12,0,12,Gett,I dont remember the movie but there was a scene where a guy just rattles off all the crazy things he did on a trip to Europe Hes narrating to all these quick jump cuts of the things he did drugs girls  It goes on for a while but I thought it was a really well done scene to an otherwise forgettable movie
2015-05-15 01:10:03,2,0,2,Gett,Forgettable is not exactly how Id call it but the vlog scene in Interstellar was high above the rest of the movie for me
2015-05-15 02:08:19,9,0,9,Gett,I mean They have tasers and kids are still getting shot
2015-05-15 02:08:34,2,0,2,Gett,He was supposed to play mace windu before sam jackson but shortly after getting the role he died The Phantom Menace was so bad it killed tupac Jar Jar Binks ruined rap music
2015-05-15 02:11:12,14,0,14,Gett,Up until that last chase sequence I was thinking that it was a pretty good action movie And then it became one of the greatest The last sequence was incredible The movie just kept getting better and better as it went on That being said given all the hype its received over the past week I was slightly disappointed Still one of the best action movies Ive ever seen but I dunno I was expecting a little more
2015-05-15 02:11:53,5,0,5,Gett,Idk why you keep getting down voted Im terrified of teleporters for that very reason
2015-05-15 02:34:07,240,0,240,Gett,The first 10 minutes Max running from the freaks getting captured trying to escape were fantastic Really gave a feel for where this series could go from here
2015-05-15 02:35:45,-2,0,-2,Gett,Really I always looked at it as a comedy not unlike burn after reading Its so tedious and long and then finally it comes out that it was all a waste of time and effort You  as the viewer are not getting that time back
2015-05-15 02:41:55,6,0,6,Gett,It was one of the better 3D experiences in a while Definitely didnt take away from the film and found myself getting surprised when they did use it
2015-05-15 02:42:58,1,0,1,Gett,My bad I was getting them confused with the Skrulls
2015-05-15 02:43:41,2,0,2,Gett,As a huge Capote fan what made it so forgettable for you
2015-05-15 02:44:20,4,0,4,Gett,Thats bad scenes in an unforgettable movie Wrong thread
2015-05-15 02:48:09,2,0,2,Gett,How can the pictures fit in my iPhone without getting pixelated
2015-05-15 02:53:33,5,0,5,Gett,Im sure if there werent tasers more people would be getting shot though
2015-05-15 03:01:15,14,0,14,Gett,The opening of 28 Weeks Laterhttpsyoutube2eFjD5S6BhUt1m26s sorry about the quality  After this scene the rest of the movie is just compounding awful decisions and pretty forgettable
2015-05-15 03:03:39,185,0,185,Gett,Seriously think about the messy forgettable action in Michael Bay movies and the bloodless zerostakes filler action in the most comic book movies and then compare that to this movie which is 88 percent nonstop action The bar has been raised
2015-05-15 03:08:35,0,0,0,Gett,People will call me mad but I find Magnolia pretty forgettable except for the Wise Up singing scene particularly when Phillip Seymour Hoffman and Jason Robards Jn are both next to each other yet singing the song independently
2015-05-15 03:18:39,2,0,2,Gett,Ugh I cant read the book or watch the movie without getting irrationally angry
2015-05-15 03:20:29,1,0,1,Gett,Give it a decade I think Wickeds getting a movie
2015-05-15 03:35:21,1437,0,1437,Gett,Its amazing how rare it is too see women getting killed in an action role  Especially older women  Refreshing change that I havent seen mentioned yet
2015-05-15 03:36:38,0,0,0,Gett,I was planning on working on the rtruefilmscores sub I carved out just so I can get something up in the vein of rtruefilm but Im such a procrastinator that I never get around to it I should really look back on working on getting it up
2015-05-15 03:40:49,2,0,2,Gett,Gina Carano and Rhonda Rousey female MMA fighters who are getting acting roles for the sole reason that they are moderately attractive
2015-05-15 04:03:22,2,0,2,Gett,Well in the Road warrior he was the main character and had events that revolved around him his feud with Toecutters crew started because of the death of the Night Rider which lead to his partner getting lit up etc etc This movie not so much
2015-05-15 04:25:31,7,0,7,Gett,Same here I groaned as the trailer dropped thinking Oh a revitalization for a cashgrab before I watched it but was pleasantly intrigued after watching the trailer  after just getting back from seeing it in theater Im blown away A
2015-05-15 04:27:34,-7,0,-7,Gett,I do agree with you in general but I would just say it is getting easier and easier all the time to tell how good a film is just from the trailers  My knowledge of movie history peoples knowledge of movie history general knowledge of shots knowledge of trailers  Sometimes I can pretty much tell where every bit of the trailer even happens practically  I avoid them now
2015-05-15 04:54:38,611,0,611,Gett,Very true I kept thinking to myself why is this feeling so unique and I realized that I never see women getting killed in action movies without some unnecessarily dramatic attention paid to the fact that she died They treated their skills dialogue action and deaths as they would any other male character and that was so fucking refreshing
2015-05-15 05:03:17,8,0,8,Gett,Because the dudes getting old Hes 61 and I doubt he can do choreographed fight scenes but I would love to be proved wrong
2015-05-15 05:05:31,2,0,2,Gett,I see people commenting on her last scene but I really dont think the movie agrees with her vision  Heres a part of what she says You know what Im realizingMy life is just gonna go like that A serious of milestones Getting married having kids getting divorced the time we thought you were dyslexic When I taught you how to ride a bike Getting a divorce again Getting my masters degree finally getting the job I wanted sending Samantha off to college sending you off to college
2015-05-15 05:23:42,1,0,1,Gett,Great movie but it wasnt as brutal as I would have liked I wanted to see more dudes getting splattered and torn to shreds by tires I enjoyed it but walked in expecting something else Beside that and that last 3d crash the movie was great
2015-05-15 05:34:24,3,0,3,Gett,Thats what I thought with Hardy Was getting all the CIA flight scene from TDKR when Hardy started the blood transfusion with Furiosa
2015-05-15 05:43:31,1,0,1,Gett,Oh yeah Its the only thing I remember of a pretty forgettable movie and I watched so many years ago

2015-05-15 06:03:27,1,0,1,Gett,I think in this case it works out pretty well though Factoring in how much time was spent doing other things such as chilling in Rivendell for several weeks or getting captured and the fact that their legs are half the length of a humans Id say they actually made pretty good time and the map sizes relate pretty well
2015-05-15 06:12:41,1,0,1,Gett,Dude i know you must be pretty tired of these replies already but congrats for getting the Spideys part I mean its not confirmed by Marvel but it looks like its happening Anyway i personally dont see any better casting as of now so i think they made or are about to make the rightest choice of them all
2015-05-15 06:15:13,1,0,1,Gett,I dont see why people are getting sick of reboots I love reboots A lot of older movies deserve to be made today with significantly better effects Sure some remakes turn out bad but thats because theyre mistreated A properly treated remake can be terrific
2015-05-15 06:30:50,2,0,2,Gett,I remember getting this on VHS and being excited for the little toy iron giant that came with it
2015-05-15 06:32:54,1,0,1,Gett,Youre getting downvotedbut I agree with just about everything you said This movie was supposed to be the Magnum opus of phase two Guardians and The Winter Soldier blew this film out of the water I think Whedon did a decent job of introducing the Avengers but like Ultron said they need to evolve I hope the Russo Bros will make that happen
2015-05-15 06:52:06,110,0,110,Gett,I only believe in sequels when Ive seen them But I think Miller seems to both understand something about sequels and is getting a way with it in practiceevery Mad Max movie has been pretty different from the next That would probably continue to be the case whether we like them or not
2015-05-15 07:14:56,1,0,1,Gett,I can at least see why some would dislike this movie What I dont understand is this movie getting 1 star I think 25 at the lowest
2015-05-15 07:21:08,0,0,0,Gett,But see thats why I asked people to think of the new generations also For YOU hes a minimal talent for others hes fantastic For some people Tarantino isnt a good  director for some hes one of the greats even tho he hasnt had a Schindlers List or Color Purple Theres style story telling and even tho I agree Spielberg is currently above JJ I still see the possibility JJ getting up there with him Thats all Im saying I can get into all the movies show their flaws show their triumphs but thats way too much typing lol Ultimately I think youre saying theres little to no chance of JJ getting near Spielberg let alone surpassing him Im saying I see the possibility thinking for myself and for the new generations of fans I could be wrong but Im open to it Quick tangent I didnt grow up with Star Wars so when I watched them later in life I could see these huge glaring flaws flaws others deny others who claim these as the greatest movies of all time So I watch them and of course I can see the effort the triumphs but also the bad These movies that werent impressionable to me growing up so this nostalgia factor isnt involved when I view something NOT THAT YOURE SAYING THAT My mind isnt in a box over it NOT THAT YOURS IS there are movies that are timeless and ageless I just dont shutout new movies because other greats exist before them NOT THAT YOURE SAYING THAT EITHER lol it could very well be that Im just too nice for years I was hyper critical I could just shred almost any movie But Im tired of that so in many areas of my life Ive adapted a more positive outlook softened been more forgiving and just less critical So it could be that either way people like what they like Im sticking with my hope and prediction that JJ will beis one of the greats and has a real chance of catching and POSSIBLY passing Spielberg
2015-05-15 07:26:54,1,0,1,Gett,I am happy that they are making this Jackie isnt getting any younger and he cant keep up his stunt career forever Strike while the iron is hot Bet the movie will be awesome
2015-05-15 07:27:09,46,0,46,Gett,I mainly agree because I keep forgetting that they are making that movie
2015-05-15 07:41:09,1,0,1,Gett,I enjoyed the Iron Giant but Im getting so sick of remakes
2015-05-15 07:45:52,-1,0,-1,Gett,Yeah I thought the same People are complaining that its feminist but at the same time we have 5 helpless women getting saved by a very manly woman and two guys
2015-05-15 07:56:49,2,0,2,Gett,It was so outta place I mean the first scene where we see Max getting flipped in his car was amazing from landscape to detail in one shot Awesome But this was some cheap crap indeed
2015-05-15 08:12:51,1,0,1,Gett,Star Wars But getting to see two towers in theater was amazing The attack on helms deep was so epic  My mind was blown I couldnt believe such an epic battle was capable of coming to life on screen
2015-05-15 08:48:56,1,0,1,Gett,gt I really dont see how this movie is getting so many negative reviews
2015-05-15 09:10:27,54,0,54,Gett,Annabelle It wasnt a good experience but it was an interesting one We decided to go to Economy Night 2 tickets at a downtown theater Seating was packed with innercity teenagers Lights go out and a literal sea of iphones ipads androids and even fucking laptops illuminated the place A lot of people continuously talked at and to the characters on the screen which I honestly didnt mind because it gave this shitpile of a movie a MST3K vibe and even made me laugh at points A group of four were busted eventually for getting handsy in their seats Movie is over lights come on and what do I see Someone had shit their pants during the movie and just left their jeans behind still sitting in the front row Ive vowed never to pay less than 750 for a movie ticket
2015-05-15 09:11:36,27,0,27,Gett,I hear you and I agree with most of what you said but here are some of the reasons why I find it to be a feminist text maybe they could convince you I dont think that the Five Wives not getting much development excludes the film from being feminist Although I do think each has agency and gets a brief moment to shine Given the frantic pace of the whole thing and its focus on MaxFuriousa I think that is an accomplishment in and of itself
2015-05-15 09:57:36,74,0,74,Gett,I dont think that Mexican girl had one line that wasnt a stereotype about her getting killed by drug cartels or something similar That kinda sucked
2015-05-15 10:28:35,-5,0,-5,Gett,Yeah they are both correct Personally the fact that the perspective of this poster among many things is getting criticised this much just reinforces how bad the designcomposition is
2015-05-15 10:56:52,0,0,0,Gett,Scary movies are getting too relevant and not so horror
2015-05-15 10:59:50,9,0,9,Gett,Really A pregnant woman getting run over by a monster truck wasnt brutal enough for ya
2015-05-15 11:13:18,2,0,2,Gett,Start with Howard the Duck and from there the movies just keep getting better
2015-05-15 11:28:40,16,0,16,Gett,Rise of Lycans is the best one because the character of Lucianand the actor who plays him is fucking awesome is the only one in any of movies that is complex and thoughtful enough to want to see as much of his story as possible  Kates character is horrible  Not the acting but just a horrible person to want to follow her story  Shes not into anything but for herself  Lucian on the other hand is a real hero  Which means his life is tragic and yet he still fights the good fight not just for himself but for his entire race nowthe Lycans getting under control of their inner self and he truly doesnt want to start shit with regular humans unless of course they want to start shit first   Of course though I get the feeling his allure is mostly from Michael Sheens skill at his craft and less from the writing of his character
2015-05-15 11:57:51,3,0,3,Gett,Yes it was an action circle jerk but your getting jerked by a supermodel on X
2015-05-15 11:59:38,1,0,1,Gett,Moscow car chase at the end of the Bourne Supremacy Amazing car chase in a film thats largely forgettable
2015-05-15 12:01:22,42,0,42,Gett,One thing I noticed was women were getting injured and killed and it wasnt used as a emotional motivator for the male lead
2015-05-15 12:08:03,1,0,1,Gett,The first and so far only movie was awesome so seeing the Iron Giant getting more love is welcome
2015-05-15 13:06:23,1,0,1,Gett,But he still has the car in Thunderdome albeit it doesnt work and is getting pulled by camels I saw this as happening after Road Warrior and before Thunderdome  Also Hardy had the scar under his right eye that Gibson got in Road Warrior but not the grey wisps Gibson has in Thunderdome
2015-05-15 13:21:54,1,0,1,Gett,I recall getting goosebumps the first time I saw Jurassic Park in a theater When we first get the see the entire TRex standing in between two SUVs
2015-05-15 13:25:58,1,0,1,Gett,This For movies with logic plot devices and introspection all of which I also love Ill see Inception or Ex Machina With Batman or Mad Max Im getting action figures and explosions more eye candy and exuberance than logic or plot Theres room for both just buckle up and enjoy the ride
2015-05-15 13:30:03,1,0,1,Gett,David Ayer Although recently hes been getting attention
2015-05-15 13:48:11,6,0,6,Gett,The long fades were an excellent technique definitely allowed the audience to breathe and contemplate what the fuck just went on before getting ready for another serve
2015-05-15 14:10:43,6,0,6,Gett,Getting a blowjob during Indiana Jones and the Crystal Skull It was the best part of the movie
2015-05-15 14:11:53,2,0,2,Gett,Thats right Getting paid to play not bad at all

2015-05-15 14:34:06,-7,0,-7,Gett,Maybe its just one his ploys to get the readers attention on him I mean if I wanted to be popular and being the nice guy wasnt getting me any attention Id be the big ahole also I mean just look at the Kardashians and all other reality TV shows for the matter
2015-05-15 14:37:54,31,0,31,Gett,I saw him talking at a con once when he was telling this story He said it was because he was an actor and getting a tattoo is dumb as if your an actor
2015-05-15 14:42:21,43,0,43,Gett,hes getting nominated for sure that is a film that works in every language and every culture  I hope its a world wide smash
2015-05-15 14:47:21,9,0,9,Gett,I dont think the movie was very quotable Honestly the movie was too forgettable to even remember the plot
2015-05-15 14:51:54,7,0,7,Gett,I remember getting chills the first time I saw that trailer I was sitting in the theater for some other movie and about 10 seconds in realized what I was looking at
2015-05-15 15:05:34,2,0,2,Gett,Its great And Oblivion wasnt too bad either People talk constant shit about Tom Cruise but forget that he pumps out relatively good movies I dig the MI movies though they are getting lamer and lamer
2015-05-15 15:09:05,29,0,29,Gett,Oh cmon just get one Were all getting it Aw cmon you dont even have a good reason
2015-05-15 15:09:11,1,0,1,Gett,From a filmmaking perspective it would have probably taken too much time to convey they needed to use the ghosts to free up some other guys to win the battle Most of the scenes with getting the ghosts help was cut from the thematic version
2015-05-15 15:23:56,2,0,2,Gett,Saved me the trouble of reading it then getting mad Thanks
2015-05-15 15:32:59,1,0,1,Gett,This is obviously MI6 looking for members of SPECTRE I knew SPECTRE had people everywhere but they have managed to get sleeper agents inside the Galactic EmpireImperial Remnant now this is just getting ridiculous
2015-05-15 15:36:53,2,0,2,Gett,His whole life was about getting approval thats all the wanted He wasnt evil just wanted to be useful and he was in the end
2015-05-15 15:39:54,2,0,2,Gett,Im getting OP jacked these from the movies IMDb trivia pages as Ive seen every single one of them there
2015-05-15 15:42:33,0,0,0,Gett,Unfortunately it probably wont but I think it deserves it One of the best action movies ever made why the hell not not just action either the acting setting etc are all top notch It better at least be getting editingcinematographyetc noms
2015-05-15 15:45:38,1,0,1,Gett,I was really hoping this was going to be one of those trivia lists that starts out looking legit then the facts start getting crazier until its obviously made up
2015-05-15 15:49:47,1,0,1,Gett,She also said she was getting a bit old for the catsuit and they they at some point said that the new movie would be a reboot
2015-05-15 15:55:52,-5,0,-5,Gett,Yeah which makes her a Mary Sue Shes fucking invincible Before the only thing that could kill her was silver sunlight and getting rekd by lycans really bad But now shes immune to sunlight and silver and she heals bullet wounds in seconds I really dont think she can die at this point
2015-05-15 15:56:05,3,0,3,Gett,Marvels been trying to destroy Spidey forever How many times have they tried getting rid of the MJ marriage Keep in mind that was the main driving force behind not just Brand New Day but also the Clone Saga Try and replace him with Ben Reilly who wasnt married
2015-05-15 16:12:19,13,0,13,Gett,Except the Wachowskis are probably not getting to do another big budget film for a while now
2015-05-15 16:16:43,19,0,19,Gett,Ya all callbacks to Norse mythology and berzerkers getting high before battle Which is an interesting thought for how one might go about running a post apocalyptic world Brainwash people into accepting death and feeling most useful by dying in battle Really great shit
2015-05-15 16:24:16,8,0,8,Gett,I used to go to a theatre in a really shitty area and all the terrible  horror movies were like this Just the audience getting super involved and yelling at the screen made some really bad movies enjoyable
2015-05-15 16:30:02,2,0,2,Gett,Good luck getting a curse lifted after that
2015-05-15 16:52:22,1,0,1,Gett,Though if you think about it getting out of the jungle was sheer dumb luck It didnt seem like she was waiting for a helicopter or even had any reason to be expecting it She just notices it flying overhead amp interprets a continued means of escape
2015-05-15 16:55:03,-2,0,-2,Gett,I never said that I just said that JRD is a straight forward dude as in he just says whatever hes thinking without much of a filter lol Also Im fairly sure that comment was made in jest to dismiss the idea of getting a tattoo I doubt he was genuinely concerned about the conditions of the parlor
2015-05-15 16:58:26,2,0,2,Gett,Much less than I expected Theres one very brief gory shot Most of the violence is action violence people getting punched and knocked off moving vehicles
2015-05-15 16:58:48,2,0,2,Gett,Gremlins 2 at the part where the gremlins stop the movie  It was the first time Id ever seen a gag like that and it took the entire audience by surprise some people started getting pissed even shouting  But when Hulk Hogan came on the screen and yelled at them the entire theater caught on to the joke and burst out laughing  The buildup of the tension really made that scene work  it was something you can only experience in the theater and really only once
2015-05-15 16:59:23,6,0,6,Gett,But that doesnt mean its good or faithful  I love PJ but like George Lucas getting his way all the time isnt necessarily a good thing
2015-05-15 17:00:14,0,0,0,Gett,I dont get how that would work though Youd have 30 minutes of Aragorn walking around the countryside getting random people to fight It works in the book but not the movie At least in the movie Aragorn summoning the ghost army is him embracing his destiny
2015-05-15 17:00:46,100,0,100,Gett,Its not that its bad its just so forgettable Ive seen it twice and I still dont remember a single plot point
2015-05-15 17:06:49,1,0,1,Gett,Battle scene  stormtroopers getting mowed down except for one that sprints across the battlefield expertly shooting opponents on the fly commandeers an enemy vehicle does tremendous hair raising stunts makes it into the enemy command bunker only to emerge moments later on some cleverly jury rigged escape route as the whole place goes up in a tremendous explosion
2015-05-15 17:18:32,3,0,3,Gett,I pissed my pants twice the first time I watched The Dark Knight I had drank two large beers beforehand and I was just tripping too hard by the time they decided to want out There was no way I was getting up from that seat True story

2015-05-15 17:27:35,7,0,7,Gett,Yeah I mean it at least positions Banner there to counter Stark The problem is that Marvel like to do this thing where they raise this idea but then distract you out of getting a resolution to it
2015-05-15 17:39:29,5,0,5,Gett,I was watching Tropic Thunder back when it was in theaters and I was in the urban theater that some of my more mousy white suburbanite friends never feel like going to even though it is one of the closest theaters around Anyway it was a matinee and the theater was empty aside from me and a few other people notably two middle aged women in the back who made the occasional comment but nothing worth getting annoyed at At the end of when they list the cast they get to Tom Cruise and in the most stereotypical way possible one of the ladies just LOSES it While this is a paraphrase I am in no way exaggerating the tone to play off the Black people yelling at movies trope this is her outburst honestly to the best of my recollection

2015-05-15 18:05:47,0,0,0,Gett,Tarantino was just an example I personally think hes one of the greats AS FAR AS stylized action and great dialog Django blew me away Joss did change the landscape but so did JJ with Star Trek he showed the world how cool these movies could be so much so they trusted him with one of the biggest franchises ever a franchise that was broken by its own creator With Spielberg he had to do things in a certain visceral way because of the times ways he probably wouldnt of done at the time if he had better options Where Spielberg is kinda tripping here and there with the new tech JJ is flourishing hes doing this balancing act hes getting better and better JJs gaining trust love fans and rebuilding huge parts of our entertainment Besides a lot of Spielbergs newer movies arent doing great yes he has undeniable juggernauts but hes not pristine

2015-05-15 21:30:53,2,0,2,Gett,Maybe  I dont really recall I seem to recall that was what he was getting up to at the beginning since it comes literally right on the heels of Casino Royale  But the villain in a Bond film cant have his crime be killed some treacherous waif last time  And so he was manipulating things to control water rights which is not that stupid  look at California and the American Southwest right now but they actually talk at one point about how the dastardly plan was to slightly increase the water bill of Bolivia or whatever country they were talking about but I seem to recall it being Bolivia
2015-05-15 21:34:36,87,0,87,Gett,Todays version of The Last Starfighter would be a found footage film where a nerdy girl ie an extremely hot girl in glasses who streams on Twitch defeats the KoDan armada on an emulator and then begins getting strange tweets and Facebook messages from some guy named Centuri
2015-05-15 21:41:27,7,0,7,Gett,I thought the trailers kept suggesting that Ultron was going to be the one getting a Vibranium body And I guess that was his plan but he never got to enter the Vision shell Once you had a godlike Vision on your side and Ultron has a basic metal body that anyone can shred and he has no means of escape then he really isnt scary as a villain in any way

2015-05-17 13:20:20,2,0,2,Gett,There were changes that were unnecessary but typical Hollywood bullshit In the movie hes carrying an ax everywhere which is typical Hollywood fearmongering In the book he carries this big mallet pounding it everywhere he goes It has so much more blunt force dramatic fear One of scariest parts of the book is when Danny is hiding and he can hear is father pounding the walls getting closer and closer telling him to come out and take his medicine What a terrifying moment for a little kid
2015-05-17 13:25:40,3,0,3,Gett,Same here I actually lost interest in the movie halfway through To me the movie kinda said everything it wanted to say when Simmons character told the Bird story which is not factually correct BTW and then a few scenes later threw a chair at Tellers character I get it  youre pushing him to become better and all that but the thing that kept getting pulling me out of the movie was how ridiculous and outrageous everything was  if a professor tried to do something like that to a student hed be banned for life hed probably get sued as well And the movie seemed to continue to drive that point almost until the end there wasnt any other substance to it I agree the performances were really good but performances are not the only thing that makes a good movie American Hustle is a similar movie  great performances but no real substance

2015-05-17 15:05:30,9,0,9,Gett,Its common among all societies to consider junkies of all types to be lowlifes and then to break them down into categories in which those who take the cheapest route are considered the lowest of the low We prefer junkies to be nameless and faceless despite the fact they are very real people with very real needs who form very real subcommunities Its a very deepseated form of prejudicedeepseated to the point I was on the receiving end of it for part of my adult life and yet I still use the term lowlife when talking about certain types of drug addicts But its not racist It just so happens that certain demographics are poorer than others and therefore resort to cheaper methods for getting high Correlation does not equal causation especially when it comes to drug addiction I dont think uMikeArrow was being racist

2015-05-17 15:46:45,1,0,1,Gett,Right sorry thats the point I was trying to make but not sure if it came across clear or not Max has spent a lifetime in the Wasteland and its likely seeing as how deep down hes a kind soul that wants to help despite his built in need to survive that there have been many people whom he wished he could have saved but couldnt Maybe some were women he fell in love with although I doubt that since I couldnt ever really see him getting over his wife I mean his nod to Furiosa at the end says it all Youre safe Im going back to the Wasteland to go back to surviving But yes overall I agree I dont think the imagery of the children should be taken literally nor do they affect the canon of the original Sprog was a boy that didnt change just getting others opinion on it

2015-05-17 17:55:36,5,0,5,Gett,I didnt even think this would be a war movie I thought it was a movie about the heavy weight that being called a War Hero carries specially when youre being called a hero after being forced to kill children and women If I really thought that the movie would be as deep as having the character second guess before blowing a kids chest 1km away and thats pretty much all youre getting when it comes down to the moral dilemma of killing a 9 year old that is carrying a bomb I would have skipped it If anything this movie seems to glorify camaraderie in war instead of addressing the problems that arise with urban and militia warfare

2015-05-18 02:22:54,-4,0,-4,Gett,They make movies about WWII but there arent that many people whore still worked up about it and start getting angry at German people when they see it This on the other hand is more recent and prolongs unnecessary racial tension

2015-05-18 03:51:28,1,0,1,Gett,Ghost in the Shell Stand Alone Complex Solid State Society the film that finished up the Stand Alone Complex iteration of GiTS I like it a lot of callbacks to the 1996 movie and just is plain visually stunning I like it though I can understand why some people wouldnt Ive seen it a few time but its a very fun movie for getting into the CYberpunk mood for writingreading about Shadowrun
2015-05-18 04:01:18,1,0,1,Gett,I think it adds to the humour to see them all getting their mugshots taken at the end and given the amount of gore that appears otherwise I figure its just for style
2015-05-18 04:49:11,1,0,1,Gett,This is the kind of Social Network movie we were promised back in 2013 Im so glad well be getting what looks to be exactly that
2015-05-18 05:04:25,3,0,3,Gett,I hadnt seen the movie since it game out so I just went and rewatched the scene on youtube and honestly Im not getting a sexual violence vibe from it Ennis definitely avoids being kissed but hes into  and starts to drive  the rest of it It seems pretty mutual to me if you switched either one out with a girl it wouldnt raise my hackles Maybe Ive become desensitized from too much GoT
2015-05-18 05:19:23,1,0,1,Gett,That sucks It was cool to see everyone in the theater is still kind of getting adjusted then you see Max eat a lizard and hit the ground running
2015-05-18 05:36:57,3,0,3,Gett,I cringe at you getting upset that some people didnt like what you did and youre acting like they are stupid

2015-05-18 07:39:14,3,0,3,Gett,Happy to hear it Im the editor on the film and I did some of the wide shots in one of the dwarf costumes and it got pretty terrifying in there There was nothing scarier than getting left behind on set and winding down a quarter mile of cavern alone Then doing it again because you left your phone in your real jacket and not the costume youre wearing

2015-05-18 08:17:36,2,0,2,Gett,Editorstunt double from the movie chiming in  During lunch time I would often stay behind in the cave by myself Usually it was to set up for the next scene but every now and then Id just turn off the lantern and sit in darkness As a kid I had a huge fear of the dark Sitting there in complete black I would lose my sense of time and spacial awareness Instead of getting anxious I felt at peace Many of the other crew members felt it too We talked about sleeping in the mine and may do it next time That place is wonderful
2015-05-18 08:32:25,8,0,8,Gett,I refuse to believe the script was merely competent The script was minimalist on purpose and its always been barebones since the first Mad Max It says something about getting rid of all the words you dont need and showing rather than telling Max himself is more like a Mr Bean action hero communicating in grunts and gestures The lack of words in the film does not mean the screenplay is lazy Screenplays only benefit films and its the end product that matters
2015-05-18 08:39:36,2,0,2,Gett,gt and yet it has been getting higher reviews than almost any action movie in the past decade Why I would be great for an explanation

2015-05-18 09:45:20,1,0,1,Gett,Disagree completely the whole filmed over 12 years aspect can definitely sound gimmicky at first but I thought it added an incredible amount to a movie that really hinges on how well we can connect with the characters Mason wasnt exactly the best character unfortunately but it really felt like going on a journey with this family by getting many small glimpses into their life at different times Ive also loved its depiction of all the conflicting feelings of being a sibling and I did notice that people with siblings seemed to love the movie a whole lot more
2015-05-18 09:55:05,1,0,1,Gett,I liked the first one a lot with Nero I thought it was excellent I liked the inside jokes to the original series but I enjoyed the story a lot  Into Darkness was a fun movie getting to see a new take of Klingons and birds of prey however I didnt like that they rehashed an old story I wanted something more original more substance A lot of people hate Star Trek The Motion Picture but I love that weird space shit where the enemy is force of naturethe unknown I really wanted a movie where they go exploring and find crazy shit

2015-05-18 14:46:19,1,0,1,Gett,Wes Anderson films never have an easy entrance if you dont immediately love them  I hated Aquatic fell asleep during Tenebaums  Loved Fox before I realized it was a WA film respected his style more with MK then abosolutely adored TGBH watching it 3 times in a week  After that I went back to his films and really enjoyed them or at least appreciated them a lot more  I think getting over the seemingly pretentious feel or hipster vibe can be an issue but I enjoy the way he handles his style  He puts passion into every little detail and doesnt just make them for the sake of being quirky and different which I believe was my original impression

2015-05-18 15:11:24,9,0,9,Gett,This answer always infuriates me  Idiocracy is the worst kind of film the kind that thinks it is way smarter than it actually is  People throw around the word pretentious for filmmakers like Lars vin Trier or Terrence Malick but if used appropriately it should be used with something like Idiocracy  Its not clever its hardly entertaining its just an excuse for people to think themselves more intelligent and better than others  The notion that humans are getting dumber as time goes on is a complete joke  we just have more of an outlet to talk about it than we did before

2015-05-18 20:30:47,1,0,1,Gett,I kept getting caught up in the problem with the time line  When is this happening  I mean in the first Mad Max society is just off from normal  Road Warrior in contrast is a total wasteland with weirdos on bikes and in carswith mohawks and no manners at all  Therea a 20 year gap at most between these two times and by Thunderdome  hes already in his mid to late 40s  Yet for Fury Road we are shown somewhat of an origin story for how he is referred to as the road warrior but things have progressed to tribal clans 3 generations old at least and an irrigation system that would have to take about 150 years to build  It would appear that this happens only  a small time before Road Warrior yet there are no remnants at all of old society It is completely forgotten and dusted over much like Road Warrior  My point here is that thered still have to be some bridge between the two times Things really went to nonsense in such a small amount of time  In Fury Road we are asked to forget about all that logic and go with the idea that max is just a guy that lives in this world but makes no attempt to explain how that much time has lapsed  Furiosa says shes  daughter of so and so so the breeding thing had already been going for at least 20 years charlize is closer to 40 anyway but for the benefit of the doubt ill say shes about 24 in this film  How could that be if max rockatansky is only himself about 34 years old  that would mean that the whole breeding for the tribe thing was happening back in the old toecutter days and that Max was only about 10 when she got born  I get hung up on this stuff but continuity and timelines are important to me

2015-05-19 09:54:44,1,0,1,Gett,Did people find that to be a good thing I havent seen the other Mad Max films but I eventually grew tired of the action and just wanted to know more about where they were where they were going what they were looking for and what was at risk if certain people died Instead I just kept getting cars blowing up via arrows and people walking around and on top of their cars through the wind and dirt I didnt really care if anyone died or if they got to the Green Place or not Are these worries of mine remedied by watching the first three Or was this film just not for me The movie felt like seven or eight scenes

2015-05-19 12:25:12,2,0,2,Gett,You know what Ill be the one person here that actually agrees with Alan Moore and Simon Pegg Movies these days are pointless ventures that are afraid to discuss contemporary issues Part of it is that we now have an army of people ready for action whenever someone does try to venture out there and make a movie with a message See for example the outrage from conservatives that Disney and Pixar would make a movie about consumerist culture in WallE and thats a film thats still a little tepid in its depth and delivery Another problem is that critical analysis almost universally fails overseas where people would certainly rather have shallow movies I think there is a demand for movies with cultural impact but not so much in other countries the ones where a good amount of the box office gross is made Finally I think some of the directors let us down The guy who did District 9 made an excellent work about apartheid and then seemed to be lost in getting anything successful written thereafter It seems like the talent for writing is not in the write place

2015-05-20 08:32:31,1,0,1,Gett,gtIt would have been a bit jarring honestly This entire society was presented as being fanatical in how they followed Immortan Joe and in their willingness to die for that cause because they felt they were destined for Valhalla In Nuxs case it makes sense because of him getting disillusioned after having three apparent opportunities to ascend to that challenge twice with the apparent blessing of Joe himself and failing so he gives up until the red headed girl convinces him not to It took basically everything he knew going to shit around him for him to finally abandon that I dont see how Furiosa could have really accomplished the same with one of the others especially since her plan in the first place wouldnt have required any of their involvement after they reached the canyon and they all presumably were killed
2015-05-20 09:28:50,1,0,1,Gett,Yes that is right Post processing companies may get ZDepth data from the production house but they will still need to make fine adjustments to each scene to keep viewers from getting sick

2015-05-20 13:44:40,3,0,3,Gett,OMG YES I mean I still think Incredibles 2 should have happened first but I tell myself thats for the better because the Incredibles crew only wanted to make a sequel if they actually had something good So if were finally getting the sequel it means itll be a good follow up and not just a because we had to sequel

2015-05-20 14:09:58,1,0,1,Gett,As somebody who never watched a Mad Max movie and went in blind with zero expectations outside of good reviews for an action movie I thinks overrated as hell Good movie overall especially with how the movies environment are setup but the plot was pretty basic and the action to get repetitive since it was all on vehicles Also the reason why you havent see many negative things is for most the part most people like it and at least on reddit the few that dont just love it and jizz over it are getting downvoted for having a different opinion
2015-05-20 14:22:18,26,0,26,Gett,Absolutely I was joking about his movies getting confused with Burtons so often that it would simplify things if they were treated as one Theyre distinguishable to me obviously I know who Selick is but not to all the people who say Burton directed Nightmare or James and the Giant Peach or Coraline

2015-05-20 14:33:32,-5,0,-5,Gett,Saw this over the weekend  it ruined my movie going experience   Whats the point in a chase scene movie   There was little to no dialogue no character evolution and the plot line was as simple as Unknown woman helps slave girls escape   And then queue chasing   for 2 hours  for 2 mindless hours   Nothing to make you laugh or cry or feel any emotion whatsoever   Im astounded that I went for starters and that it is getting such rave reviews
2015-05-20 14:35:51,1,0,1,Gett,Goddammit I was getting excited too I thought it was actually a change
2015-05-20 14:49:19,2,0,2,Gett,At that point in the interview they talk about when Mel was originally cast before production broke down the long waits and Mel getting older  This isnt about a cameo from Mel which is what was being claimed

2015-05-20 15:13:34,1,0,1,Gett,At the same time its also disappointing to see anybody with an opinion that isnt praising the movie to be nearly perfect getting downvoted or not upvoted nearly as much as the people making useless complimentary comments like I couldnt stop jizzing the whole time greatest movie ever made1 Its not about the upvotes or downvotes either its just that peoples opinions are getting hidden because they go against the grain Ive seen people make perfectly fine comments without being insulting like I thought the plot was a bit predictable and the action a little repetitive but still think its a good movie get downvoted or have a controversial tag on them
2015-05-20 15:15:55,4,0,4,Gett,I found the story to be rather simple Max is in the desert getting chased by psychos trying to survive and while the story was simple I felt everything around them was so well polished and thought out that I was satisfied The warboys werent some faceless cannon fodder towards the end I felt bad for them because they were just manipulated pawns The cannon fodder had motivation they wanted to be witnessed and die for their god king The religion the movie created was fairly fleshed out down to how they held their hands to pray to V8 the three facets of who killed the world religion war and greed The lack of warter and the work arounds with titty milk farms The universe provided enough information and history to paint a vivid picture for me Max has always been a man of few words but I personally feel like you bog him down in any lengthy speaking roles hell suffer
2015-05-20 15:18:34,9,0,9,Gett,Ehh after watching recently Avengers AOU Im left disappointed I was expecting a good menacing villain and good plot and what I got A film that has only one advantage of seeing in cinemas over tv screen The visuals But how many films nowadays are like that When will the will become saturated when will it be enough Im getting grumpier and grumpier as I realise it wont happen soon because despite me feeling that way I still go to the damn theatre and watch another iteration of these super humans flying around I already know I will go and see BvS and SS But to what end Its also pissing me off that EVERY SINGLE ONE of them is PG13 thats why Im looking forward to Deadpool maybe it will be more gritty I should discharge my batteries more before going for another remake of a remake

2015-05-20 17:31:24,1,0,1,Gett,I think its both gets then nice and shiny while also getting then high so they can rampage their way to Valhalla It pretty much brings that one guy back to life so he can sacrifice himself an instant later

2015-05-20 17:42:45,15,0,15,Gett,PG13  wider audience  more money  To be fair though were getting some gritty content with Daredevil and the upcoming Deadpool movie and I dont see much need for an Rrated Avengers or Guardians of the Galaxy etc  The storylines those films were based on werent particularly adult  Would be nice to see an MCU Punisher movie or series  And speaking of which and speaking of Tom Hardy hes interested in doing Punisher  I think that would be great
2015-05-20 17:46:32,3,0,3,Gett,I think stylistically breaking to Maxs recon mission would have broken the constant feel of a car chase that the movie had  I loved the scene it kept the tension on the focus of getting the war rig moving and escaping instead of shifting the main point of tension to is max going to survivekillget back in time it keeps it focused on the chase and escape

2015-05-20 18:43:19,0,0,0,Gett,I wouldnt downvote them but I have seen some criticisms that were simply too low effort The fact is that this movie is getting universal praise so a comment like the action was repetitive is really hard to take seriously The first rotten review on rotten tomatoes spent about 2 paragraphs talking about the actual movie and the criticism essentially boiled down to not enough max If you are going to take an opposing position on something receiving so much acclaim you need to be able to articulate it beyond it was lame or youre going to get downvoted Is that fair  Not always But I honestly havent seen many people actually go into detail about why they didnt like the movie Heck the only friend I have that didnt like it simply said too weird

2015-05-20 19:43:16,3,0,3,Gett,I assumed it was because they were all so brainwashed so as to treat Immortan Joe like a god To die for him would gain you recognition and passage through the gates of Valhalla So by chroming up they were amping their crazy selves up to die and were super excited about getting into Valhalla

2015-05-20 20:58:53,5,0,5,Gett,Thats because if you direct a pilot you get residuals everytime any episode of the show is broadcasted repeat or premiere Directors of that particular episode also get compensated but whoever directed the pilot gets money regardless of which episode it is Its a very very very wise investment on behalf of these directors and its why you find them jumping on the start and never returning Usually the showrunner directs the first one though ie Breaking Bad Six Feet Under even though theyre usually writers Depends obviously but in those cases getting residuals for every episode makes more sense

2015-05-20 21:09:33,-4,0,-4,Gett,I should have said that I thought the third act was cliched with Oscar Isaacs character getting stabbed The ending itself felt pointless to me because it didnt really raise any questions nor resolve the story Its not that I am demanding a happy ending like the one you just described Which would have been awful I agree but I would have liked something more thoughtprovoking This is a really fun movie to compare with Her They have similar themes and subjects but the story is executed in a completely different way I think Her handled it more tastefully

2015-05-21 10:05:43,1,0,1,Gett,Theres a bit in revenge of the sith that really bugs me with the way that Lucas cuts the music during the scene with yoda fighting the emperor in the debating hall The music is building towards the duel of the fates theme but then it cuts off out of nowhere If yoda escaping through the tunnels was ramped up with the fates themes blaring and the emperors force lighting destroying the tunnel around him it would have been amazing That theme is arguably the best part of the prequel trilogy so it was really anti climactic to hear the build up to it without getting it Sort of like sonic blue balls

2015-05-21 10:46:30,6,0,6,Gett,Im getting pretty sick of this women represented unfairly in the media stuff  If the person who makes the movie wants the part played by a younger woman that is THAT PERSONS right  Make your own movie with old women and young men  That is your right too

2015-05-21 11:26:52,1,0,1,Gett,Im gonna try to be as nice about this as possible but isnt it the men that usually pull in the audience Since were mostly talking about leading men not being paired with someone whos around their age wouldnt it be safe to say the men are what are making these movies successful or not I mean side roles play a big part aswell but the main character will make or break your movie Im sure if these men werent getting people to come to see these movies they wouldnt be in em either

2015-05-21 12:38:54,-3,0,-3,Gett,Its her fault for auditioning for a love interest at 37 That tired old face is going to see a lot of rejection Being a woman exiting her prime she probably cant comprehend how the world doesnt give a shit about her anymore since she is so used to getting her way like a spoiled cunt
2015-05-21 12:38:55,8,0,8,Gett,And the general audience doesnt care about fair representation either they prefer watching hot women in their early 20s getting naked on screen not Maggie Gyellenhall
2015-05-21 12:42:25,1,0,1,Gett,Depends Efficient can be quite a compliment  it suggests getting to the point and getting the job done which is sometimes exactly what you want from a movie Probably not the case with this particular movie but still
2015-05-21 12:46:25,3,0,3,Gett,I wasnt going in that direction more like If a script writer or a producer has stuff to add to the movie it will be a shoehorned romance plot or some 19 yearold eye candy with no other function If you have a role to fill for the plot its more likely going to be a dude than a dudette Joss Whedon is still getting praise for how he writes woman like they were people just as George RR Martin does just some examples off the top of my head

2015-05-21 12:52:26,11,0,11,Gett,With all due respect to Maggie and her work she certainly does not look 37 I think thats the issue is not that shes 37 the problem is that she looks a lot older  and of course these producers and casting agents dont want to tell her that She looks more like 4550 Maybe its hair her style her cheekbones i dont know but she looks 10 years older Nevertheless show business can be cruel to the aging but Im sure they all knew what they were getting into
2015-05-21 12:53:29,1,0,1,Gett,Good point not many sad turtles get to play Christian Bales love interest The other good point people are making is that she wasnt whining for older actors when she was 18 getting parts

2015-05-21 13:09:03,2,0,2,Gett,No thats what Im getting at Youre judging something based on something you dont have all the information for Im not talking about everything else Im talking about this current situation Im saying theres a possibility that she genuinely is too old for the character Or maybe the casting guys a dick Who knows I dont and you certainly dont So why are you judging something with info you dont have
2015-05-21 13:12:01,3,0,3,Gett,On the contrary what I am saying is that these women are hypocrites for making an uproar about ageism and sexism but got no problem with getting a role soley based on their looks
2015-05-21 13:23:34,1,0,1,Gett,John Wick pulled it off I actually thought it was really interesting having a movie where the bad guys are the clear underdogs by a huge margin Spoilers At the end you almost feel bad for the boss despite the horrible things he has done when you see him just totally checked out and losing it in the SUV The dude is just laughing and getting drunk and how he fucks with the other guy when he asks for a gun His whole demeanor his look just screams oh you want a gun LOL for fucking what reason You actually think a gun is going to make a difference And onwards until his final scene where he is just like fuck it lets do this
2015-05-21 13:23:46,1,0,1,Gett,Youre kidding right Of course her looks matter its Hollywood Its an extremely image driven culture One of the most popular Hollywood magazines actually has Vanity in the title Also men age better than women in the attractiveness department Thats a shitty fact of life but its true On top of all that there are plenty of attractive women over 35 still getting roles Michelle Monaghan Vera Farmiga Charlize Theron Cate Blanchett Naomi Watts Leslie Mann Tina Fey Marisa Tomei I think if shes going up for a role where her looks arent the focus of the role then she has a case for being unfairly rejected However if she is up for a role where she is playing the love interest and the attractiveness is central to the role then she shouldnt be surprised if someone 15yrs younger than her gets it Or if someone more attractive than her gets it

2015-05-22 20:29:32,6,0,6,Gett,I think that a big part of the decline in good horror films is that there isnt a ton of unexplored subject matter for these types of movies to draw off of Couple that with studios going back to the same formulas over and over again and it means that what we are getting is usually a poor version of a story weve already seen told There are still a few movies a year that manage to buck the trend of bad horror but often times those movies truly excel in areas other than the plot atmosphere acting effects sound etc  I also wonder if the ratio of bad to good is the same in horror as it is in every other genre but we just get less horror movies being made which in turn means less good horror movies being made
2015-05-22 20:32:39,3,0,3,Gett,Theres really not that much interest in great horror Neither of the examples you mentioned made much money The rote slasher flicks are junk food that still keeps getting sold As long as the moviegoer keeps shelling out for empty calories the message is that people PREFER badly made horror films and theyll keep coming

2015-05-24 00:53:43,6,0,6,Gett,Haha youre probably right man Im not going to lie I think Ive become overly critical of films recently looking for deeper plot lines watched Mulholland Drive really enjoyed it whereas I think Kingsman is more lighthearted stuff if we can call it that with the church scene in mind haha Anyway I appreciate the discussion over all the downvotes Im getting in an opinion thread P

2015-05-24 03:05:17,29,0,29,Gett,I disagree Half the fun of the book was getting to see how Mark Watney thought his way out of every problem The ending was so satisfying because this one human refused to give up and spent a year and a half of his life finding basically the one and only way he could survive You cant take away the science because thats the driving mechanism of the book
2015-05-24 03:19:32,2,0,2,Gett,Gibson was cast up until around 20032004 when the film kept getting delayed and Gibson went off and did Passion of the Christ instead Then obviously the whole public meltdown etc happened and sometime afterwards George Miller decided that Mel was too old to play Max for this particular story While it wouldve been pretty awesome to see Mel returning to the series after 30 years Im glad they went a different way and cast Hardy I think its a bit of a gimmick nowadays to bring back an older actor to return to their iconic role and usually it doesnt work out very well so kudos to them for having the balls to do it

2015-05-24 16:10:10,2,0,2,Gett,I remember getting a hold of a soundtrack to an RPG a week or two before release I listened to the whole thing and when I finally got my hands on the game it was a really cool experience recognizing the music and matching it with the moments Ive never done this with a movie but Ill never forget the feeling it gave me To know a song or tune before its collaborated with the moment
2015-05-24 16:12:04,2,0,2,Gett,I love to watch old movies i had as a young boy because it reminds me of getting better when i was a child and the comfort of home So seeing me throw on Shrek Princess Bride Harry Potter or any Disney film wouldnt be a shocki would say they are good as well to answer your question

2015-05-24 16:31:15,19,0,19,Gett,He has shown no skill ability and none of his fathers charisma He shouldnt be getting these roles

2015-05-24 16:46:45,31,0,31,Gett,Im personally getting tired of the quartersecond jump cuts for actiondisaster movies Theyre usually synced up to some extremely high or low pitched soundtrack that tries to build a sense of doom and threat but ends up being super annoying not to mention cliche at this point

2015-05-24 18:06:00,32,0,32,Gett,Regardless of what it ends up with it will be considered a success considering the trouble they had getting it made  You dont see a lot of studios spending 150 million on R rated action movies and I dont think Warner Bros intended to either  So even if its not profitable its not a huge loss like Tomorrowland is looking up to be  And eventually theyll make their money back on the home market   Im sure Warner Bros is very happy with the numbers theyre getting

2015-05-24 19:31:01,3,0,3,Gett,Interstellar I wish I had seen it in theaters It blew me away It felt so different from most sci fi movies being made nowadays  the early parts of the movie made me feel like a kid getting geekily excited about space travel again  Loved the psychological aspects of the story felt like it really touched on a lot about what makes us human good and bad Some unexpectedly emotional moments Imaginative and perfect climax really captivating It felt long but everything felt necessary and it helped the movie feel like a massive journey  I cant really think of anything to complain about in this movie actually except maybe that it was hard to make out the dialogue in a few parts

2015-05-25 03:04:52,2,0,2,Gett,no the point of the thread is terrible actors getting work not a decent comedian with a large fan base getting work  your looking more at the likes of kim kardashian or some one else like nick cage or shiloh lebuff
2015-05-25 03:18:15,2,0,2,Gett,The story was extremely simple which works for a lot of movies like Alien except here it was also unremarkable and rather forgettable We dont like him so were driving over there No now were driving back

2015-05-25 19:10:23,38,0,38,Gett,The NeverEnding Story would be fantastic Give it a big budget and cram Falcor down the throats of the young Also I completely disagree with Gone Girl getting a remake Fincher is one of if not the best directors in the US That is like saying they would remake Taxi Driver or Pulp Fiction
2015-05-25 19:23:10,62,0,62,Gett,Being it is 15 years old I would say the Matrix getting a reboot or another sequel with different cast
2015-05-25 19:29:15,2,0,2,Gett,Precisely Some of the best ideas in film history came from that second guess you get from limitations In modern cinema everyone except maybe in the indie realm can go with their first idea Often they need more development and more thought but instead of getting that chance to rethink their ideas or find a new approach they just go straight ahead Doesnt help that the suits keep breathing down their necks to get the product complete
2015-05-25 19:37:31,-3,0,-3,Gett,I have the opposite problem with critics since for the last decade they have been getting too soft on action movies  These days an action movie getting in the mideighties on RT means it is probably OK  How did the good but very disappointing Mad Max Fury Row get 98
2015-05-25 19:41:51,1,0,1,Gett,Without being able to fly Zod doesnt have a chance Superman doesnt need to pick him up he just needs to punch him upwards once After that Newtons third law means that Zod only has his bodyweight as leverage in the air He cant even turn around effectively Superman could pick up a steel beam or something and hit Zod in the back repeatedly keeping him in the air The only thing Zod can do at that point is to disable his suit and quickly learn to use new powers but that might be a bit hard when hes getting punched repeatedly and by the time he succeeds theyll be out of the city at least

2015-05-25 20:10:45,2,0,2,Gett,You know thats kind of what Im getting from it Maybe I shouldnt try to seek for a storyline that isnt there and just accept that its a great visual and action film Not every film has to outright say the background story of every character
2015-05-25 20:38:54,1,0,1,Gett,Youre getting downvoted because some folks like that its preaching doom to children and using a pessimistic Clooneyapproved outlook as its sermon I used indoctrinate in my post and that guaranteed it was heading to negative integers Meh sometimes ya just gotta buck the popular opinion and take your downvotes Personally I would have preferred the writer kept it an approach plot and showed a wonderful future rather than an avoidance plot mired in doommongering When looking at the night sky what should we show the children the stars or the darkness
2015-05-25 20:40:15,5,0,5,Gett,Man is this a disappointment After hearing that Will Poulter was set to play IT with Fukunaga directing I gotta admit my expectations went from not really caring much about the sequel at all to really anticipating it Kinda bummed we wont be getting Carys vision of the Steven King classic but something tells me it was probably studio related where maybe he wasnt getting to kind of freedom he was hoping for Hes definitely proven to be more than capable but I can see why the studious might have wanted to keep him on a short lease given his modest body of work as of now

2015-05-25 22:56:10,40,0,40,Gett,To me the single example of why the movie failed was getting rid of Veidts last scene In the book hes speaking with Manhattan and as usual is incredibly confident as Manhattan says hes leaving earth Then Veidt asks It all works out right In the end With a bit of uncertainty in his eyes And Manhattan says Nothing ever ends And he vanishes leaving Veidt to contemplate
2015-05-25 23:12:06,3,0,3,Gett,The fuck are you talking about Its been getting 45 star reviews across the board
2015-05-25 23:14:01,1,0,1,Gett,First this movie was pretty bad in the end so its not a good representation at all It was fairly fun in the beginning disliked the interruptions in the beginning though but then it dived halfway through and the end was ridiculous Second as going to the movie is getting more and more expensive it just not worthwhile paying to watch something you can easily enjoy watching at home on your own large screen tv The way I see it the only exception is if you need to watch it on special 3D screens to fully enjoy the movie Most of these sort of movies are big superheroremakesetctype movies Theatres are shooting themselves in the foot by making it more and more expensive to go watch movies at the cinemas
2015-05-25 23:15:46,1,0,1,Gett,so you are angry people wont see a film that is getting trashed by critics has a preachy ending Cowboys and Aliens tried to be original too and it fell flat on its face too
2015-05-25 23:31:10,2,0,2,Gett,It wasnt a bad movie I thought it was forgettable though Except for that one scene which goes way deeper into the whole humanmachine thing than the originals ever did
2015-05-25 23:38:04,1,0,1,Gett,Read my post again the whole point is to make it so that they cant do that at least not _just_ for use of image archive footage etc that doesnt require them to actually work My use of the phrase mandatory licensing means that the person getting paid doesnt get to say no or how much they just get a preset amount of money Itd be like how music composition rights work  bands have to pay to do a cover of a song but they dont need permission
2015-05-25 23:55:39,2,0,2,Gett,Still find it ironic Brandon Lee plays a ghost in The Crow Love that movie but so upsetting he died on set like that I heard Rochelle Davis girl who played Sarah did not return to the set because she witnessed Lee getting shot

2015-05-26 02:16:31,8,0,8,Gett,So many final deaths though Not like the other recent flicks where everybody lives or is getting rescued off camera None of that jumping out before the car explodes GI Joe horseshit on Fury Road Its a rare thing in cinema today outside the torture porn stuff

2015-05-26 02:45:48,38,0,38,Gett,You dont really have a point though do you Her new movie is getting good reviews which you wont accept as valid to the point that youre accusing top critics of getting paid for their good reviews and you think she is Rob Schneider just cuz they both make dumb comedy movies like most other comedians who get big budgets
2015-05-26 02:58:29,2,0,2,Gett,Id argue that if she was sending it to someone privately it was with the intention of getting them off and thus would be classified as porn whereas the nudity in American Beauty was not there just to get the audience off Thats a big difference

2015-05-26 03:34:20,3,0,3,Gett,I only saw the preview for spy but the first 35 seconds has a really hilarious part Rest was forgettable but its worth it for the first scene in the fancy restaurant
2015-05-26 03:46:06,4,0,4,Gett,Watch the trailer The first 35 seconds has a joke thats worth the time it takes to find it The rest is kind of forgettable but it didnt look bad at all Definitely a future Netflix watch
2015-05-26 03:53:45,-1,0,-1,Gett,When I saw this movie the first time I was craving chicken like crazy and I liked at my friend and she looked at me like I made this face where he knew like lets go get chicken but we didnt want to leave the movie we paid for it you know so we watched for a little bit but the craving was getting bigger and look at my friend and we were like lets go get chicken we HAVE to so we decided to sneak out real quick and sneak in some chicken from this local place and oh my gawd I dont ever remember not being so much having this amount of crave for chicken for the rest of my life

2015-05-26 04:41:20,2,0,2,Gett,I thought the film started out with promise and raised alot of questions And then thats all it did I was expecting the film to be the journey WITHIN Tomorrowland or to spend more time in it but it was mostly about them getting to Tomorrowland and when they did it was all a let down I felt just as fooled as the main character The ending is what really takes one whole star away for me It creates a lot of questions about why casey is special and how she is going to fix things She seems to have some mystical direct effect on everything and knows how they work but the solution couldve been figured out by anyone
2015-05-26 04:42:10,3,0,3,Gett,Except this movie has been getting great reviews  I might actually see it
2015-05-26 04:52:07,2,0,2,Gett,The average score of all of her Rotten Tomatoes movies is 42 not including a bogus 100 for this Spy movie coming out  Rob Schneiders average score is 21  Both have done over 500M in box office sales though McCarthy has done it in half as many pictures  Lastly while Schneider isnt exactly a hunk  one would say McCarthy has a far greater wall to climb in terms of being an overweight female comedian  So overall I would say the stats show McCarthy is twice the actor twice the earner for producers and had a much harder time getting where she is than Rob
2015-05-26 05:17:14,3,0,3,Gett,Well it is kind of He says they didnt want him in the film because of the differences he had with them on the first one so when they made him an offer on the second it was a lowball on purpose 150k when the guy playing biff was getting 300k and the girlfriend mother 600k He said they didnt want him there and they were just fucking with him  that they knew he wouldnt accept it and they were planning on the substitute from the start That way they could say they couldnt come to an agreement rather than we didnt want to work with him
2015-05-26 05:28:01,1,0,1,Gett,Many films shown at film festivals tend to have a skewed amount of good reviews prior to getting a larger release Probably because the people who chose to see that film already had enough interest in that film that they chose to see it over other events and films playing at the same time

2015-05-26 06:14:42,2,0,2,Gett,Inside Out is already getting raving reviews I had never even heard of The Good Dinosaur before this comment is it late 2015
2015-05-26 06:22:42,3,0,3,Gett,The whole series kinda has a loose continuity between films The kid and voices Max hears are implied to be people he couldnt have saved in the past Doesnt really matter who they are as long as it gets across that Max has spent a lot of time alone with voices and iswell mad Think of it like watching Iron Man 3 with Tony Starks PTSD but without having seen The Avengers to get the context Best example I could come up with at the moment As far as Splendid goes she died She went under the wheels Joe held up her body and the Organic Mechanic clearly said something to the effect of her taking her final breaths They have no need to save her because theyre more concerned with getting an heir and hopefully saving the child So the Csection was performed on a woman who is near death and the blood loss from that was what sealed her fate

2015-05-26 06:33:58,6,0,6,Gett,Im struggling to gather what you mean here Like a sequence would beLukes encounter in the cantina on tatooine or Neo and Trinitys fight to free Morpheus I can see your statement on FR as a two hour car chase but it still had separate sequences And John Wick had a LOT of clearly distinct sequences So what I think your getting at is a story that seems continuous with few pauses or twistshalts in which case I think youre describing most good movies I cant think of a way to describe your concept without seeing it in pretty much every movie
2015-05-26 06:35:56,2,0,2,Gett,I guess I meant competent in the sense that he doesnt typically make unwatchable or unbearably flawed movies Yes Man was fun though forgettable
2015-05-26 06:42:54,109,0,109,Gett,Right Which is unfortunate especially since one of my favorite moments in AoU relies on the romance  the scene where Banner is getting Widow out of the castle thing and they have this touching moment and theyre gonna go off togetherand then she pushes him down the shaft to get the Hulk instead I mean its played for laughs but thats a huge moment The one person Banner began to trust to believe wouldnt see him for the monster he struggles to control and then that shit happens Heartbreaking

2015-05-26 07:36:53,1,0,1,Gett,Thats cool I saw Fury Road and thought it was pretty good too but Im honestly really surprised about how highly praised its getting Maybe it was a little overhyped for me but I was expecting a little less Road Warrior and more just Mad Max Still though not saying it wasnt good but I just feel like there was something missing
2015-05-26 08:05:48,1,0,1,Gett,Gettysburg is brilliant
2015-05-26 08:07:43,22,0,22,Gett,essentially yes less fluff theres far less time spent between the action On top of that when one sequence ends the characters arent going around doing things unrelated to the action they are going straight back into it or soon will be In a Transformers movie they have a fight then go around trying to solve some new puzzle In Dredd they leave one fight ready for the next one thats whats on their minds In Wick he goes from one fight to get ready for the next not solve the intricate clues left by mob goons to find his target Mad Max they are just running you know they are getting chased and caught in another deathrace soon after getting out of the current one
2015-05-26 08:24:39,6,0,6,Gett,gt  I feel like some SF fans are getting upset largely because of the absence of technobabble
2015-05-26 08:26:20,1,0,1,Gett,Yeah I really enjoyed this documentary Not being familiar with the real story I was very surprised at some of the twists the film took and it manages the shifts in tone perfectly changing with ease from an adventure story to something much much darker and getting quite philosophical to the end The filmmakers were obviously working with limitations in terms of available footage and didnt want to go too far down the reenactment route and I think they did a fantastic job given what they were working with A riveting watch
2015-05-26 08:33:14,78,0,78,Gett,I loved how the secondary female characters were also badass The wivesbreeders were essentially sex slaves but they weret just there to be sexy like most female secondary characters in action films These women were complicated and all had different personalities I also like how the women were on the same playing field as the men regarding getting in on the action I was pleased to see the first wife die and watch Furiosa all the wives and the female tribe members fight because female characters are typically not allowed to be involved in the violent scenes Furiosa wasnt necessarily the hero of the movie and when she the other badass tribe womenwives Nux and Max all joined forces they were much more powerful and able to accomplish more Equal opportunity badassery death and violence Thats feminism
2015-05-26 08:36:39,2,0,2,Gett,I bought it before seeing it and after finding out all that I could about it and I was pretty confident I would enjoy it I watched it once and found it forgettable I had been thinking about giving it a second chance and you have just convinced me

2015-05-26 09:02:55,2,0,2,Gett,Why does Divergent get split and getting more money More people would probably collectively watch the Divergent movies than a split up IT remake Thats why Divergent can get away with it Stephen King adaptations are also pretty hit or miss both critically and at the box office IT remake is not guaranteed to make ITs money back and probably just isnt worth the time for a lot of people involved
2015-05-26 09:03:11,1,0,1,Gett,I totally agree But those in charge of that decision couldnt give any less of a fuck about that I hope it wont happen but its futile A teen into science getting involved in time travel with a cooky scientist Itll happen someday Lets just hope Zac Effron isnt attached

2015-05-26 12:55:33,-4,0,-4,Gett,I swear to god Tom Hardy Ryan Goslin and Christian Bale are all slipping into being type casted as aspie tough guys  I blame the internet and all the trolls who worked their way into the script writing industry are finally getting their glory day with socially awkward but totally bad ass motherfuckers in every movie
2015-05-26 13:30:21,-2,0,-2,Gett,I dont know why youre getting downvoted youre spot on All three of them are fantastic actors but they get typecast as handsome muscly autists
2015-05-26 13:35:56,7,0,7,Gett,Max spends a good portion of this movie especially at the beginning getting shit hammered for that matter it happens to him a lot in the series  If it wasnt for them being there in the first place and for them eventually trusting him he didnt stand a chance  There was significant tension up until the first scene at the canyon where it was strongly implied Max was on the cusp and he knew it
2015-05-26 13:40:03,4,0,4,Gett,I thought Tom Cruise was the helpless damsel getting rescued
2015-05-26 13:42:41,1,0,1,Gett,What most intrigues me is the fact a film which essentially looks like it only has one simple plot point from the trailer is attracting so much attention To me it looked like Wacky Races meets Borderlands for a whole movie but it seems that premise actually works and is getting some outstanding reviews
2015-05-26 13:43:22,1,0,1,Gett,Dont forget about some of the great documentaries and indie releases coming out this year either The Act Of Killing followup The Look Of Silence sounds extraordinary we should also be getting Youth in 2015 and theres the new Alex Ross Perry film Queen Of Earth to be excited about Oh and the little or um not so little matter of Magic Mike XXL ducks to avoid abuse
2015-05-26 13:43:46,-10,0,-10,Gett,maby because new movies start to be boring and cinema is losing its appeal most movies you can tell the complete story in a trailer and rest is cgi spam and a half naked teenage girl getting old very fast
2015-05-26 13:57:59,1,0,1,Gett,well never stop getting sequals and remakes unless we do something drastic like as a society we decided to give up something to stop sequels and remakes completely Like if no one not a single person went to see the new star wars That would stop remakes forever We would take the biggest movie in history and tank its remake No more ever again
2015-05-26 14:15:19,1,0,1,Gett,I love about 95 of No Country For Old Men but everything about that ending from spoilerss the main guy getting killed on seemed way too sudden compared to slow build up of the rest of the movie

2015-05-26 14:38:26,-1,0,-1,Gett,So im getting the feeling this movies tone will be schizophrenic  I dont think a movie can be dark and serious with that Thomas the Train scene in it  It doesnt flow at all  Keeping Wrights jokes and making a serious movie around them will be the movies downfall
2015-05-26 14:42:56,1,0,1,Gett,Agreed about the prebuilt world I think too many movies hold our hands and explain all the nuances of the settings to us and ultimately drag down the momentum of the story Another movie I felt did an excellent job getting us right into the story was The Incredible Hulk Marvel knew we were already aware of Hulks origin and showing a brief sequence of the story during the opening worked great
2015-05-26 14:52:59,1,0,1,Gett,dont see why youre getting down voted you have legitimate reasons
2015-05-26 14:58:02,2,0,2,Gett,Why do we need another David O Russel movie with Bradley Cooper and Jennifer Lawrence Nothing against the cast or Russel for that matter but this same formula is getting stale I was not a fan of American Hustle either

2015-05-26 15:05:27,9,0,9,Gett,Pretty sure he isnt going to be in the new movies They already have Shazam and Cyborg and there has been zero info on anything Manhunter related plus the to group is already getting kind of big and in most iterations you either get Cyborg or Manhunter not both
2015-05-26 15:09:59,1,0,1,Gett,Yup Through out the film Nathan is painted as the villain manipulative and a destroyer But he is simply testing his product and thats how it has to be done for it to be ready for life and obviously Ava was not ready for life as she showed no regret in killing Nathan killing her creator Along with manipulating a naive boy into getting out leaving him to die a slow painful death
2015-05-26 15:31:30,1,0,1,Gett,In general I agree with you but for an example of how to incorporate some romance without getting cheesy Id look to Edge of Tomorrow I think the relationship between Cage and Rita made sense with the plot and didnt hit us over the head
2015-05-26 15:33:13,1,0,1,Gett,Halfways through the movie when they reach to other side I thought the movie was done and got kind of bummed that it ended so sadlythen the movie just went on and I thought Wait Whats going on here Queue them going in the truck and panning to Immortan Joe and I though holy shit Am I getting more movie now

2015-05-26 15:57:14,3,0,3,Gett,You really need to see the original Great story highly charismatic characters very memorable and quotable dialogue and some unforgettable action scenes There is absolutely no reason to remake this movie other than it being a blatant money grab by the studio
2015-05-26 16:12:52,1,0,1,Gett,Cake seemed to get a lot of praise due to Anistons performance but I felt her role was very disposable and the film was forgettable

2015-05-26 17:50:32,1,0,1,Gett,Indeed    that is an incredibly tragic story  Neuromancer may be the best movie that hasnt happened yet  Not only is it a much more interesting story but I understand King Crimson was interested in doing the soundtrack for a 90s effort at filming Neuromancer  Even today    especially today    I think a tale of excessive corporate power and the rise of artificial intelligence would resonate well with moviegoers  However the intellectual property keeps getting bought up by asshats who cant get it together enough to make the picture

2015-05-26 17:56:53,5,0,5,Gett,It actually was surprisingly good I hated on it until I caught a marathon by accident one night and fell in love only to discover it got canceled after one season  The animation takes some getting used to but trust me Id rate it The Batman level of quality at least

2015-05-26 18:58:55,1,0,1,Gett,All these major film festivals Cannes Toronto Sundance Venice etc are trade shows where movies are screened and deals are struck with distributors from around the world to get the movies out You can typically count on the winners getting some sort of distribution deal after which they start discussing release schedule and strategy The amount of time before say a US theatrical release can range from a month to a year or two and sometimes never Last years Palme dOr winner Winter Sleep was released in December
2015-05-26 18:58:58,19,0,19,Gett,Bodhis whole philosophy is centered around thrill seeking naturally acquired adrenaline and an outright rejection of societal norms  Getting radical as it were  Big wave surfing skydiving and robbing banks to fund these activities falls right into line with this  The plot in Point Break is absolutely seamless in this regard

2015-05-26 19:04:01,6,0,6,Gett,Im really getting tired of MCU movies where the enemies are endless clones of dronesaliensrobots The one thing that the Xmen series got right is that they have mutants actually fighting each other minor exception with Days of future past with sentinels but in that case theyre not useless powerless drones

2015-05-26 19:05:27,9,0,9,Gett,Just in terms of the horror genre its giving a lot more people the tools with which to tell their story  The result of course is a lot of terrible horror films  But Id argue that the genre is as strong as its ever been  The difference is that some of the best horror films are no longer getting a theatrical release  Theyre going right to Netflix and other streaming services  And the crazy thing is that the creators dont seem upset by this  Ive talked to numerous directors who never even in their wildest dreams envisioned a theatrical release  It was more important to them to get the film out on as many platforms as possible  To me this is nuts as when I started in the biz a theatrical release was the end all be all  But who am I to argue with the filmmakers themselves
2015-05-26 19:06:47,0,0,0,Gett,Talking to you is like betatesting a bad video game I try to move in one defined direction and in response things just go randomly haywire and I end up getting pushed around in circles Its fucking nuts
2015-05-26 19:18:05,1,0,1,Gett,I just saw this film today and went in rather blind as what I was getting Well what can I say I dont really know what I watched or what I saw or if I even likedislike it I think im more aiming towards disliking this film while it had its good parts eg decent stunts action sequences Thats all it had for me the characters just seemed to be placed in the movie for the sake of it There was no backstory as to who everybody was and why they were doing what they were doing Joe felt boring not really giving me a bad guy feel unlike somebody like Bane which i personally think Joe was trying to look like or be I know I may get some hate for this but Charlize Theron seemed to be out of place and comfort zone for me she seemed as if she was in the movie purely because she was a women Tom Hardy played a good part but the crazy mad scenes were again random and unexplained What can I say about the plot errm there wasnt really a plot they started at the Citidel and ended up at the Citidel after driving one place only to drive back

2015-05-26 20:15:48,1,0,1,Gett,It was awful but not for that reason Youre forgetting that the original short story doesnt take place on Mars at all only references the time he was there Its much smarter than the 80s movie and the remake wanted to get back to that but failed Going to Mars again is not at all integral to a good telling of the Total Recall story
2015-05-26 20:19:51,1,0,1,Gett,Apologies I think I must have misremembered the Comedians conversation with Moloch However the book definitely lets you know that the psychic emissions of the squid were negatively affecting peoples psyches In a personality and politically driven conflict like the Cold War that could easily translate to increased aggression and reduced chance of peace Thats what Im getting at I dont think thats a big leap at all even if its never explicitly confirmed in the book
2015-05-26 20:37:53,4,0,4,Gett,Film TV and Radio at UWMadison  Although I learned very little about TV and nothing about radio  And my major was ZERO help in getting me a job  Probably if I went to USC UCLA or NYU I would have had a leg up but I dont regret a second of it

2015-05-26 21:23:04,2,0,2,Gett,Theres no way these kids were like 1718 in high school and getting into underground racing clubs and getting involved with underground Yakuza shit And that just makes Han seem weird hanging out and illegally street racing with a bunch of crazyass teens Also none of them look like high schoolers Still I really like the movie
2015-05-26 21:24:34,6,0,6,Gett,Honestly I thought the High Sparrow cough made for a great villain It was a little bit different from the usual criminal mastermind but he was still interesting Maybe its my nostalgia speaking but I consider it a much better film than Quantum of Solace which I considered thoroughly forgettable
2015-05-26 21:34:29,1,0,1,Gett,Interesting  so I guess Rodriquez has quietly rejoined the DGA he quit over Frank Miller getting codirector credit on Sin City and it cost him several movies to go back to making studio pictures
2015-05-26 21:41:26,56,0,56,Gett,This also bugged me about some peoples criticisms with Gravity Say what you will about the story which I personally felt was very compelling but getting nit picky over minor technical errors when there is such a stunningly beautiful movie to be seen that really does more to try to preserve as much realism as possible than not is just so stupid

2015-05-26 23:53:44,0,0,0,Gett,To be fair Fury Road is actually a very interesting film because of its simplicity Its very realistic in the regard that in such an extreme situation as evading desert armies while protecting people who would die without you there wouldnt really be that much time for telling the other people who you were or getting to know them very well
2015-05-27 00:10:43,4,0,4,Gett,One thing that really bugged me was him talking about the score and how once she enters the ISS the scene goes silent He treats the score as if it were actually supposed to be in the scene as a part of the actual setting which is just plain idiotic Its an effect for the audience I really had a hard time even getting to the point in the video where he talks about that because all of his errors are just pointing out tropes

2015-05-27 00:56:12,1,0,1,Gett,See the part with the Organic Mechanic was what through me off because as someone else said the accents make it difficult to know what he said and I was under the impression that she lived Even if she didnt though the ambiguity of her getting killed was unnecessary and pulled me out of the moment

2015-05-27 02:11:26,1,0,1,Gett,I already pointed to what I thought was a pretty good example of a remake I wouldnt consider a cash grab  De Palmas remake of Scarface another might be Carpenters remake of the Thing  Its basically the difference between a film getting made due to the inspiration of the writer andor director vs a purely profit motivated thing where a journeyman creative team is hired by a studio to provide some plot points approved by committee and maximize marketing potential etc
2015-05-27 02:12:02,1,0,1,Gett,Id kinda like to see some sort of reset The power levels started getting a little out of control past Cell and not necessarily in a good way
2015-05-27 02:37:08,1,0,1,Gett,Specifically the raptors getting onto a boat and killing the crew happened in the original book too although that plot line never went anywhere once the team wiped out the raptor nest and the park got napalmed
2015-05-27 02:39:09,1,0,1,Gett,The Compy scene was straight from the first book which is why it was good Same can be said for the spinosaurus chasing the team down the river in the third movie which was taken from the book in a scene where the TRex swims after them down a river Also the guy getting taken down by a horde of Compys later was how a character died in the first book too

2015-05-27 05:47:09,2,0,2,Gett,From what I know the producers originally wanted to make a point break 2 However they couldnt cast the same actors because they didnt have enough money So instead of making point break 2 with a full new cast they were forced to  remake the first point break Bummer that its getting so much hate I was actually very intrigued to see what Chris Taylors vision for a point break sequel was
2015-05-27 05:55:42,1,0,1,Gett,I cant believe this is actually getting released in theaters it looks hilariously bad
2015-05-27 06:46:16,1,0,1,Gett,I mean it probably makes sense but I think presenting this as a standalone video makes a pretty bad case for the channel when what it really intends to do is tease it If I hadnt bothered to click the rest of his videos this would probably stand out as a pretty forgettable featurette and I would just move on without a care
2015-05-27 07:15:13,2,0,2,Gett,This gripe was very small for me for this movie But I think its been getting worse A lot worse as of late Nolans editing has been very awkward and very hard to follow Mainly due to the lack of establishing shots
2015-05-27 07:35:48,2,0,2,Gett,Ava getting the ride from the helicopter pilot was important in the that it showed that the Turing test worked against an unknowing civilian and that she can easily blend in with society Thats how I saw it at least

2015-05-27 12:00:49,0,0,0,Gett,Thats just a regular time paradox The Movie even deals with the time paradox in that it explains that getting past it is essentially the achievement TO create a time loop to undo a paradox and all that shit Thats the Movies equivelent of warp 9 we understand that we dont understand it and we percieve it as impossible but we accept it to be there because it is there

2015-05-27 14:13:39,1,0,1,Gett,I think the starting point for cinematography is photography Mastering the still is the first step to developing an eye for scene compositions   In that regard there was an excellent book that we used in college Sight Sound  Motion Applied Media AestheticshttpwwwamazoncomSightSoundMotionAestheticsProductiondp1133307353 by Herbert Zettl  It at least goes into the components on a cursory level before one starts getting into the technical aspects of achieving them with different lenses lighting film stock etc

2015-05-27 14:44:22,1,0,1,Gett,gtReservoir Dogs took a hefty portion of plot points and scenes from the 1987 Hong Kong flick City on Fire starring Chow YunFat  YunFat plays a cop who infiltrates a group of jewel thieves makes really good friends with one of them and ends up in a warehouse after a botched robbery with the group results in him getting shot in the gut  Eventually the remaining thieves standing get into a Mexican standoff that results in everybody getting shot after which YunFat confesses to his friend that hes actually a cop

2015-05-27 15:32:55,2,0,2,Gett,Could still be true because the budget doesnt usually say how much is for marketing and how much is for the film  it is usually considered one budget  Honestly I think it is going to vary from company to company  If you google hollywood accounting youll find that many companies consider massive blockbusters and successful films to be failuresfor tax purposes getting out of contractual payments and more  Its pretty sickening  I remember when 100 mil was the standard for a movie making it huge now it is probably closer to 2250
2015-05-27 15:59:50,0,0,0,Gett,So my argument is invalid because of conditions you invented Well I think you only like it because you saw it in space while riding a dolphin No one was more excited for that movie than me I made everyone I know read the book in preparation Even my mom I listened to the soundtrack every day I bought that issue of Empire magazine and read it over and over again just imagining how great this was going to be And then I got an overtextured glowing futuristic mess The problems with the film outside of the fact that absolutely nothing is left to the viewer to figure out because its spoon fed to you like pea and carrot paste down a babys throat have nothing really to do with the script It is the way everything is presented Its one of the most misdirected films Ive ever seen Gone are the sobering brown and grey tones in favor of more eye catching primary colors So to do we trade unflattering silver age costumes for the fetish gear average viewers expect from a forgettable popcorn romp Any scene that relies on subtlety is played down or abandoned completely in favor for more sizzling 3D friendly action rendering the motivations of our characters somewhere between befuddling and utterly nonsensical Looking back on that Empire article I shouldve known better Snyder describes Watchmen as something he didnt believe he was supposed to have  A dirty little secret Just one more hollywood figure who thinks grim and violent are synonyms for serious He clearly believes that what makes Watchmen an adult story is sex but what makes Watchmen an honest adult story is that the characters talk about it afterwards These are the moments that get cut down to make more room for Silk Spectre spinning through fire in slow motion Even scenes that are violent but in a way that is supposed to make us uncomfortable like Rorschach with the dogs are minimized or replaced with uncomplicated glorified American movie violence But even with all that said I still bought the Ultimate Cut when it came out My first bluray Trying to make sense of the mess Trying to prove to myself that I hadnt been so misled The Ultimate Cut is a noticeably more interesting film mostly for the inclusion of more material dealing with Nixon and the doomsday clock But its still just four hours of hyperstylized easily digested crap It belongs with movies like Fast and the Furious and Expendables when it should be at home with Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy and Argo
2015-05-27 16:00:20,2,0,2,Gett,1 It seemed to me that the instability in Cuba was less of a concern for Michael than whether he can trust Roth He may have speculated that the Cuban rebels could win but he was definitely not sure if Roth was somebody he could continue to do business with Roth orchestrated the assassination attempt on Michaels home and he backed The Rosato Brothers in NYC I think Michael went along with Roth for a period as part of his keep your friends close and your enemies closer mantra It wasnt until Roths plan was clear attempting to assassinate Pentangeli and getting him to cooperate with the Feds that Michael decided to hit back at Roth

2015-05-27 19:34:13,2,0,2,Gett,So this was shot with two cameras rather than one Because the only reason he would need to improvise that a random call coming to that phone that probably wouldnt even be plugged in in the first place would be because Freeman was reading his lines on one camera while he another was getting an ISO on R Lee Ermey which would be surprising to me that they would ever shoot two cameras under Fincher So if it was shot with one camera that one shot would be an ISO on Ermey and the phone would ring he wouldnt be saving significant any takes from being scrapped Unless he was saving some random reaction takes of himselfdoes this make sense

2015-05-27 21:14:36,2,0,2,Gett,Its tough these days Ticket sales are giving the impression to studios that established franchises make the most money It sucks that fresh ideas are sorta getting the shaft but if a movie studio has the choice between shitting out an Avengers clone and tripling their budget or taking their chances on something new that might not even earn its money back  well it is a business after all I dont like it either but thats unfortunately the way it is
2015-05-27 21:16:30,1,0,1,Gett,I think a great example is the new Mad Max the stuntwork in that movie is insane And it really felt crazy good and awesomely spectacular BECAUSE it was real its hard to pinpoint But the stunts felt like they had more weight Sure Transformers had 400 cars flying 40 feet in the air and a giant metal robot crashing into a building but I did not feel the same rush about that as I did when just ONE car was crashing in Mad Max because my brain knew that the Transformers action was 80 CGI whereas the Mad Max stunt was real So even though there is less stunt happening in Mad Max it had waaay more impact because its real cars flipping and driving insane with real people hanging on to it and getting flung of it

2015-05-28 02:47:11,1,0,1,Gett,Saw this in Toronto last year and was very pleasantly surprised I was a bit hesitant to see a movie about chess but I gave it a shot because of Edward Zwick Liev Schreiber and Tobey Maguire It ended up being one of the best that I saw at the festival and Im glad its finally getting its release

2015-05-28 03:46:34,1,0,1,Gett,Well weve also got the original Mad Max which regardless of Millers disdain for continuity clearly states he had a son If they are going to explicitly keep the knee brace from getting shot in Mad Max keep the fact that he was a cop and keep the exact car he stole from his precinct garage then theres no reason to think Mad Max 1 isnt canon

2015-05-28 05:43:52,1,0,1,Gett,Its getting better certainly but the industry still has an issue endorsing blockbusters with leads who arent white males Fast and Furious is a good example of positive change as is Mad Max re women but Hollywood still doesnt employ nearly as many women in lead roles as men Diversity isnt a guarantee of success but it allows more people to enjoy their own demographic being represented If the industry needs a nudge to allow more blackgaywomenetc into their films whatever otherwise it might take a century for the scales to reach equal representations youll never have fully equal representation in film thats downright utopian but itd be nice to see more original characters that represent reality not like these worlds filled with strictly white male leads Funnily enough Shaun the Sheep was one of the most progressive films Ive seen this year and its an animation simply because its world was populated by people wearing religious headgear different nationalities and different cultures It was nice to see a world so closely resemble our own

2015-05-28 09:57:50,3,0,3,Gett,Yes but its not exactly easy to balance all that out On paper or in the actual logistics They have built a universe SO big and its constantly expanding that just getting Thor or Cap onto one of the shows is weeks of negotiating and paper work on top of the dominos of storytelling
2015-05-28 11:56:18,2,0,2,Gett,Ive seen the film twice and remember people mentioning the continuity issue with arch getting blown up then being rebuilt when they go back So I took a mental note of it on the second viewing If you watch carefully the explosion actually happens just in front of the arch from the left hand side So the arch itself is never actually blown up Just all the rocks from the explosion are thrown over the arch entrance

2015-05-28 17:14:16,5,0,5,Gett,I know exactly what you mean Its getting harder and harder to reserve my judgment of this movie The character designs thus far have been very disappointing And I still think Will Smith would have been a better Rick Flag than Deadshot
2015-05-28 17:32:39,3,0,3,Gett,Youre getting a lot of great suggestions I just wanted to suggest The Searchers with John Wayne directed by John Ford Beautiful cinematography scenes that inspired a few scenes for Star Wars good story I just noticed there werent many westerns suggested to you and The Searchers is one of the best Stagecoach 1939 is also very good The Quiet Man is also another good John Wayne movie Its set in Ireland so its not a western but its a classic Another classic western is The Treasure of Sierra Madre

2015-05-28 18:18:26,4,0,4,Gett,Yup his character was such an important pivot point in the movie  Up til him it seemed like Wick was just this grieving wuss who got his butt kicked by a snotty gangster  Then Leguizamo confidently bitch slaps this guy who up til then seemed like the alpha The fear of getting on the bad side of John Wick was so real and it was just the start of showing the transition of John wick from grieving widower back to killing machine
2015-05-28 18:30:21,90,0,90,Gett,Its funny I really like the movie but the whole time I was watching it I kept expecting the other shoe to drop and for something bad to happen  Like the scene where the cops ask for his food license  I was certain that was going to end in him getting shut down at the end of the scene  Nope

2015-05-28 22:32:21,2,0,2,Gett,The Jurassic Park analogy is actually really a good comparison because the exact reasons why the second and third movies are so comparatively bad are the same reasons why I think a lot of people didnt like Godzilla The second and third movies revolve around a forgettable plot and stiff cardboard cutout characters whereas the first movie had really fantastic action was focused on the monsters but also had really quite exceptional acting In my opinion you need a mixture of both good acting and a monster focus for a monster movie to be considered good

2015-05-28 22:52:49,1,0,1,Gett,I didnt care for it either  the movie seemed to rely more on big special effects rather than good scares  the article mentioned no one in the house hearing the falling toys and I felt that way too  Also why werent there any neighbors on the street when the boy was getting thrown around by the tree  Wouldnt they hear that

2015-05-29 02:02:58,6,0,6,Gett,Honestly while I can see the things youre getting at I wasnt engulfed It just felt like it was trying way too hard to be an overthetop pastiche that it actually became distracting Instead of actually being able to focus on what was going on the heavy aesthetic was more of a distraction in itself than an accent and the dialogue was frequently less amusing as it was cringey All together it comes off like an exercise in how to overdo a pastiche in every way possible

2015-05-29 04:08:12,1,0,1,Gett,Spoilers I wound up rewatching it Granted its definitely still a plot hole but the I think the audition was just sort of their lives Getting in required following the orders given without question and working as a team As Ruffalo says at the end more or lessThe greatest magic trick was taking four solo acts and turning them into one act Donno if that helps at all but that pretty easily let me write it off
2015-05-29 04:21:22,6,0,6,Gett,I was surprised at how little gore there wassure a bunch of people died but almost all of the deaths were off screen or in the background and with the exception of Immortan Joes mask getting ripped off which was barely shown there was almost no graphic violence It wasnt something I really noticed until the end though which I think is a testament to the quality of the action
2015-05-29 04:33:20,1,0,1,Gett,Getting to this kind of late I think there are multiple interpretations
2015-05-29 05:05:10,2,0,2,Gett,A movie can use a baby getting skullfucked as a plot device doesnt mean its not controversial
2015-05-29 05:23:58,0,0,0,Gett,A baby getting skullfucked with the guy who did it getting caught at the end is not controversial It can be sickening like human centipede but since in the world of the movie they treat baby skull fucking as controversial and something thats evil
2015-05-29 05:33:43,2,0,2,Gett,They changed the ending to Terminator 2 because it didnt test well The original ending had Sarah Conner in that park she dreamed about getting nuked Its Judgement Day And nothing happens No nuclear war The good guys win they successfully defeated the machines and judgement day never happens Big happy Hollywood ending
2015-05-29 06:02:19,5,0,5,Gett,This film is getting eviscerated by the major critics The worst film Crowe has created says Variety The review is hilarious They are almost in shock at how bad this movie is That being said I still want to see it just for the cast and location shots
2015-05-29 06:23:44,4,0,4,Gett,Ill be honest I only made through 10 minutes of this before shutting it off Im all about camp and being over the top but this is over the top for the sake of being over the top It feels old and overplayed already There really isnt much to like about this Its the loose idea of a parody of 80s action and I keep getting the feeling it tries far too hard to be something funny by just beating a number of overplayed tropes to death in really quite boring and predictable ways Plus Im not a fan of how this movie looks at all I understand the tight budget presented by kickstarter and whatnot but it just looks like crap I understand the aesthetic feel that its going for but its not translating well at all Finally after skipping around a bit and reading the comments here I see the whole David Hasslehoff thing and in all honesty its a major turn off Hasslehoff is acknowledging the parody of himself and the writers are super acknowledging it  by putting him in there in the first place Its so stale Maybe I just dont get it anymore but all of this has been done before and in a far better fashion Hell that first fight scene with the arcade machine was possibly one of the lamest things Ive seen in a while and the cuts to make it look like it was a tracking vcr made it less appealing Im a fan of being camp and over the top hell Black Dynamite is one of my favorite movies to watch regularly that being said this was just absolutely a mediocre and unfocused genre parody Not really worth the time in my book

2015-05-29 09:16:29,10,0,10,Gett,These type of movies have always been a disconnect for me Watch millions of people die without any chance of survival but care really hard about this dysfunctional family that keeps getting lucky

2015-05-29 12:32:44,8,0,8,Gett,Ive directed both and yes it is  You do direct actors  Vocal performances have to capture almost all the same emotions and exertions that distortbring to life dialogue  And the body acting has to be understood and evoked to the same ends with the director getting the animators to perform through their avatars  And no the technical stuff isnt really different  The main difference is the weight of the objects being manipulated to achieve the same ends  You have to place virtual lights just as you do actual lights  There are virtual lenses and film stocks to consider  You need to design sets and props and costumes identically  Scoring is scoring  You need to establish framing and mise en scne in just the same ways  You need to choreograph motion and blocking in animation just as you would in reality  Pacing and narrative flow all call upon the use of the same Film Language and Editing Syntax  Have you never heard of  storyboarding and previz as employed by liveaction directors

2015-05-29 14:20:08,1,0,1,Gett,I think they are getting better Alice was shitty Maleficent had serious flaws but did a lot of stuff right and Cinderella is just a fantastic movie all around Heck I think its one of the best Disney liveaction movie to date So I have high hopes for their new remakes Ill be content with just retellings and improvements upon the originals but some spinoffs like Maleficent can be good if done right
2015-05-29 14:22:22,2,0,2,Gett,Agreed  I havent seen it in a while but I recall thinking they were the only two outstanding performances in the movie and the only two that werent forgettable or hammy

2015-05-29 14:47:50,2,0,2,Gett,Tomorrowland had tremendous potential but was really underwhelming  Most movies today feel that way as well  Its getting to the point where I tell myself The longer I wait the less money Ill have to pay to watch something Ill forget about in a few days
2015-05-29 14:52:28,2,0,2,Gett,We arent getting original films  The last two movies I watched were Interstellar and the Imitation Game Its not like the original film industry is dead so going and seeing movies that look god awful like Tomorrowland isnt going to change the film industry

2015-05-29 15:18:08,1,0,1,Gett,Reddits userbase sure loves to talk about supporting original films but getting them to pay for them is another story There is a reason Hollywood does not take many risks anymore and it is all you damn movie pirates
2015-05-29 15:19:12,1,0,1,Gett,I thought about this while seeing the new Avengers movie  Its all action movies and disaster movies  We dont have anything inventive anymore like Star Wars  Star Wars changed the world forever  lightsabers the Force the Death Star  Fucking rad  Everything these days is so forgettable
2015-05-29 15:20:28,2,0,2,Gett,Im getting the vibe that youve not heard of Pirates of the Caribbean
2015-05-29 15:38:27,1,0,1,Gett,Thats pretty much my point It broke what could have been a pattern of escalation that has not always served sequels very well Also Alien did have a small collection of weapons The flamethrower being most prominent Compare this to 3s bucket of fuel and a stick Im not saying Ive broken down the movie perfectly but you see what Im getting at 3 could have followed in some aweful footsteps but it took some interesting chances Didnt totally pay off but you will note that nobody is talking about Alien 4 or the AvP movies
2015-05-29 15:48:20,0,0,0,Gett,LOST FINALE SPOILER You could make the case that the Island stopped the aging process for Ben once he lead The Purge suspending him in time until he helps Jack and Hurley in the end and comes close to redeeming himself Thats why hes not so quick to go into the church because he has unfinished business The real case was that Bens shitty dad made him age pretty harshly Always telling him how he killed his mother and getting drunk it didnt work well for Ben as he grew up and by age 20 he looked like a middle aged man
2015-05-29 15:49:37,2,0,2,Gett,Another poorly marketed disney film was John Carter  Although John Carter was actually a pretty entertaining film  Had no clue what I was getting into though  The previews marketed it as a horror thriller or something

2015-05-29 16:07:40,-5,0,-5,Gett,wait Mad Max didnt have cringe worthy exposition Everything before Furisoa taking the tanker out was just borderline pointless and the revel was just awful Mad Max is getting a pass here because the movie didnt give a fuck about anything but making a cool chase movie In that regard it succeeded anything that was not an action scene was borderline awful Luckily it was 95 action sequences

2015-05-29 16:27:53,6,0,6,Gett,Im surprised Lindelof is still getting work after Prometheus Everything about that film except the cinematography was atrocious
2015-05-29 16:49:12,0,0,0,Gett,gt Its purely cinematic without getting bogged down in homogenous clicheridden pandering in order to attract the biggest audience It forgoes things like a tacked on love interest subplot or cringeworthy clunky exposition
2015-05-29 16:51:34,2,0,2,Gett,I think the phrase just another action adventure flick is not meant to be a shot at the genre nor a call for a new genre to be created Rather its just a simpler way to say that the movie was a forgettable and mediocre action adventure flick
2015-05-29 16:53:31,5,0,5,Gett,Writing a large script with freedom before getting feedback is good He now knows exactly what the movie is

2015-05-29 17:05:05,1,0,1,Gett,I agree with everything this guy is saying Except that hes using Tomorrowland as an example  It was like a live action version of every Disney movie  follow your dreams work hard never give up and you can be whatever you want to be  It was a little sickening to be honest  The movie was visually and conceptually cool but it lost me with the delivery  I felt like I was getting preached at with that Clooneyesque flair  I agree with ihateredd1t that John Wick is a much better example of an original Hollywood movie that was good and loved by a lot of people
2015-05-29 17:10:14,1,0,1,Gett,I love the fact that an argument for getting better art is higher profit for the artists  Once upon a time artists made the best art they could because thats what artists do  These days artists are no longer for the art they are for the profit
2015-05-29 17:13:41,2,0,2,Gett,For me I take it to mean that the idea for the film doesnt have to be something different but well made A formula story for example doesnt matter so much as what you can do with it Romantic comedies are one example The boymeetsgirl story has been done to death but so what Im more interested in that sameold story not being another forgettable movie
2015-05-29 17:22:54,4,0,4,Gett,Except it wasnt very fun You spend at most 10 minutes in the Tomorrowland you thought youd see going into the movie and then its a drab tale about getting to the broken down Tomorrowland

2015-05-29 18:54:52,0,0,0,Gett,This dude must be getting paid by Disney First tomorrowland was just one really long advertisement for a theme park and soft drinks Second there is no real lack of original movies especially in a generation where film festivals are covered main stream media outlets  This is not good

2015-05-29 21:22:52,0,0,0,Gett,Yes thats 2nd wave However I dont see how this movie did anything that countless other action movies didnt also do Its only getting this feminist attention because it was noted that Miller hired a feminist to go over the script correct

2015-05-30 11:57:37,0,0,0,Gett,Forgive me if I dont take that as 100 accurate Its all guess work with percentages thrown around that dont total up to a whole Distributors can make up to 60 This chain gave 54 of its ticket earnings to the distributors This means studios get between 5055 on average Well which is it Because if the studios are still getting half or more on average then how can the distributors get half if they also have to pay the theatres too Different deals and negotiations This is also outdated information based on statistics from 2010 and theres not a single example with concrete numbers from a major studio

2015-05-31 07:49:17,1,0,1,Gett,thats not true googles labs are secretive and they are able to be very secretive in part because they do not subcontract or need to procure materials from outside sources because they almost always acquire whole companies before exploring new areas of rampd im sure in the case of bluebook there would be news of these biotech acquisitions but its normal for companies like googlemicrosoft to invest pretty eclectically this topic is getting far from the actually movie but i really dont think this concern is a reason for doubting the caleb AI theory there are much better reasons

2015-05-31 17:20:18,25,0,25,Gett,Im impressed that were finally getting to see the Park in fullswing something I so wanted to see way way back in 1994  So Im happy that theyve gone this direction with the franchise instead of continuing to tell smaller stories about unfortunate groups of people who keep stumbling onto the dilapidated ruins of something we never actually got to see  And how can you ask if the storytelling on display is impressive when you admit that its just a total of three minutes of footage

2015-05-31 18:21:08,137,0,137,Gett,The difference a few decades makes If Dre did that now thered be a dozen cameraphone videos of it and it would be getting endlessly dissected on TMZ Fox et al Hed be ruined If there had not been video of Rice it may never have come out I always insist no matter how bad people think things are the fact is the world broadly and consistenly keeps getting better
2015-05-31 18:31:36,1,0,1,Gett,And Im saying that even with my guard down low and I enjoy the film for what it is and for entertaining me in certain parts Im still going to give it the analysis it deserves and not be lenient Just because Avengers 2 and San Andreas had great moments and entertained me at times does not mean they are getting better analysis simply because I enjoyed parts and decide to ifnore the flaws Look even with all of my favorite films I still notice the flaws and acknowledge them The only types I am a bit more accepting of are horror films that try and films that know what they are I want to add Marvel to it like everyone else but they just arent doing it for me

2015-05-31 20:45:26,4,0,4,Gett,I am really amazed how this movie keeps getting better every time I watch it I mean even Pulp Fiction got kind of bland after the 5th or 6th time watching but Lebowski just keeps it up
2015-05-31 20:57:57,3,0,3,Gett,The last five minutes of Trainspotting for me Brilliant use of music to create tension the editing is damn near perfect and the final monologue had me so relieved I was laughing almost crying After everything that came before I dont think the conclusion couldnt be more satisfying I still find myself getting emotional thinking about and I watched the movie over a week ago
2015-05-31 20:58:53,2,0,2,Gett,I love movies that take a chance on black and white in the digital age But as great that that film is if you wanted to make fun of the increasingly long amount of time you need to wait for studio logos before actually getting to the movie its an easy target to lampoon

2015-05-31 23:13:24,2,0,2,Gett,I kinda see what youre getting at but I gotta disagree For one thing the conscious rappers you mentioned were at their prime a few years after NWAs peak Straight Outta Compton was released in 88 3 Feet High came out in 89 and De La Soul is Dead in 91 For ATCQ their best album The Low End Theory came out in 91 so I dont think NWA had much effect on the development of those groups There was already an east vs west coast schism that had been around since the early 80s so the styles developed independently of each other and there was not a lot of crossinfluence Dr Dres The Chronic had a greater effect on the rise of gangsta rap but even then in the years following you still had conscious rappers on both coasts that we still look back at as classic artists

2015-05-04 14:13:40,-2,0,-2,Avengers: Age of Ultron,Apparently avengers age of ultron is a travesty of a movie and and the subpar super hero writing deems it unacceptable to watch
2015-05-04 15:11:34,11,0,11,Avengers: Age of Ultron,gtAs well as its links with Star Wars Pinewood has been home to the James Bond franchise and also recently played host to the Avengers Age of Ultron production

2015-05-04 22:30:28,3,0,3,Avengers: Age of Ultron,gtIn September 2010 during a press conference for the Iron Man 2 Bluray and DVD release Feige stated Weve already started discussions with Scarlett about the idea of a solo movie and have begun putting together concepts But The Avengers comes first75 In February 2014 Feige stated that after exploring Black Widows past in Avengers Age of Ultron he liked the idea of exploring her past further in a solo film which already has development work done for it76 In October 2014 Feige said that Black Widow would play a primary role in the Avengers film in the MCUs Phase Three adding Her part in Avengers Age of Ultron is very very big and further develops and further enhances her character The plans that we have for her throughout the rest of the Avengers saga is very very big and lynchpin in fact to those films So instead of taking her out there or instead of doing a prequel which we havent done yet continuing the forward momentum and the continuity of the Cinematic Universe Of which Widow is a key key part77

2015-05-08 11:38:02,3,0,3,Avengers: Age of Ultron,My bad I meant to say opening weekend as in Avengers and Avengers Age of Ultron

2015-05-12 20:40:45,1,0,1,Avengers: Age of Ultron,It happens a lot on opening weekends Recently Ive had it happen for both Pacific Rim and Avengers Age of Ultron The whole audience was just really excited to be there and really reactive to what was happening on screen Thats the kind of thing that makes going to the theater worthwhile
2015-05-12 20:41:53,1,0,1,Avengers: Age of Ultron,Judging by all the goddamned jokes in Avengers Age of Ultron I believe him
2015-05-12 22:37:15,6,0,6,Avengers: Age of Ultron,I think not because Avengers Age of Ultron released a week earlier on some countries so its like 17 or 18 days now Furious 7 premiered globally on April 2
2015-05-13 02:38:46,5,0,5,Avengers: Age of Ultron,That in the end is what makes Avengers Age of Ultron the ultimate Marvel movie  in the grand style of the comics these are characters who for all their powers and abilities are as full of selfdoubt as we are have feet made as much of clay as ours These arent the gods of the DC pantheon theyre fucked up confused people doing the best they can Longform shared universe serialized storytelling isnt for everyone although the box office indicates its for a lot of people but it allows Marvel Studios to tell stories about characters with long complex arcs characters who rise and fall who progress and regress

2015-05-21 09:41:43,0,0,0,Avengers: Age of Ultron,The Mad Max Fury Road hype and ensuing criticial reception killed Avengers Age of Ultron Like Age of Ultron was dragged out to the middle of the Wasteland shot in the head buried and then had its guzzoline stolen by Fury Road
2015-05-22 00:58:12,6,0,6,Avengers: Age of Ultron,Avengers Age of Ultron Because its so freash in the minds of many I really liked it but it felt like it was a 4 hour movie cut down to nearly half and come to find out its true Joss Whedon had to cut a lot and I think its very noticeable
2015-05-22 03:03:45,14,0,14,Avengers: Age of Ultron,Thats one of the things I found annoying about Avengers Age of Ultron Whedon constantly feels the need to broadcast his jokes Im starting to think the guys about as subtle as a cinder block
2015-05-22 04:20:59,3,0,3,Avengers: Age of Ultron,The Avengers Age of Ultron  the Iron Man vs Hulk fight was pretty fun
2015-05-22 10:29:25,1,0,1,Avengers: Age of Ultron,Absolutely Just recently I saw Avengers Age of Ultron twice and I think it was even better the second time This weekend I think Ill go see Mad Max Fury Road again in IMAX this time

2015-05-23 22:22:31,9,0,9,Avengers: Age of Ultron,The question was what are some movies where the hero isnt out the save the world  I saw both Avengers Age of Ultron and Mad Max Fury Road in the same week  Avengers had to stop Ultron to SAVE THE WORLD  Mad Max was really just trying to keep himself from getting killed  He helps people along the way because deep down inside he knows its the right thing to do  I think thats what makes the movies great
2015-05-26 03:53:58,1,0,1,Avengers: Age of Ultron,Mad Max offers itself to practical effects because the world its set in is postapocalyptic and its sort of an empty landscape With Avengers Age of Ultron the world is set in the present so it offers it self more to CGI because the landscape is huge and full of life And to be honest how else were they going to do the flying Ultron bots  In which I admit the CGI couldve been a bit better
2015-05-26 13:55:14,1,0,1,Avengers: Age of Ultron,I saw Avengers Age of Ultron the day before I saw Fury Road While watching Ultron throughout the exposition scenes on the farm I could hear the sounds of explosions screaming and revving engines from the next room where Fury Road was being shown
2015-05-26 22:37:11,1,0,1,Avengers: Age of Ultron,Recently Avengers Age of Ultron Ive heard lots of people say that Ultron was not scary enough because he was cracking jokes left and right He had maybe 4 or 5 funny lines at the most and was a solid villain otherwise

2015-05-28 13:53:21,14,0,14,Avengers: Age of Ultron,Avengers Age of Ultron It definitely wasnt bad at all but the trailers especially the 3rd one made it look so amazing but in my opinion it was one of the weaker recent Marvel movies
2015-05-28 16:40:04,-1,0,-1,Avengers: Age of Ultron,Going by box office grosses mine is also Avatar It just never looked appealing to me Also in the top ten that I havent seen include The Avengers The Dark Knight Star Wars Episode I and The Dark Knight Rises Within the worldwide top ten add in Furious 7 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2 Avengers Age of Ultron Iron Man 3 and Transformers Dark of the Moon

2015-05-30 18:11:34,1,0,1,Avengers: Age of Ultron,Im waiting to watch Mad Max Fury Road Avengers Age of Ultron and Furious 7 in theatres in succession right after my exams
2015-05-31 21:44:43,3,0,3,Avengers: Age of Ultron,All the best ones are taken so I guess Ill throw out Avengers Age of Ultron It was great to see all of our heroes fighting as one again for the first time in 3 years The cinematography music choreography and dialogue are all great and really set the tone for the rest of the film
2015-05-01 02:03:40,3,0,3,Kung Fu Jungle,came out last year as Kung Fu Jungle plot is pretty throwaway as youd expect from most kung fu movies its got some great fights but theres also some pretty awful CGI in it overall if you like kung fu movies youll like this if its not a genre you normally watch dont bother
2015-05-02 16:36:04,6,0,6,Chappie,The complaint of ultron becoming evil too fast is one I dont understand From movies like her and heck even Chappie were starting to see realistic portrayals of AI  that progress on a timeline scale unfamiliar to us In those first minutes of Ultrons life he had come to a conclusion that wouldve taken a human years or even decades to come up with So in a way its okay if we dont fully understand him or his motivation as hes on a very different level than us
2015-05-03 09:01:08,2,0,2,Chappie,Chappie had some of the most photorealistic CGI Ive ever seen The movie itself was horrendous
2015-05-03 09:32:31,1,0,1,Chappie,Chappie and Short cirquit
2015-05-03 15:26:39,86,0,86,Chappie,Exactly another film that was panned was Chappie  Sure it wasnt Citizen Kane but I loved it  Alot better than Transformers Another One
2015-05-03 16:11:59,24,0,24,Chappie,Chappie had some interesting questions hidden in that mess of a story but they got lost along the way when the film started trying to accommodate more mainstream audiences There were two competing stories in there one was a story about consciousness and what it means to be alive while the other is a slow burning summer action movie about two rival coworkers in a military tech company The resulting mess from combining these two stories was so bad we had a guy two rows back from me who audibly said this is fucking stupid at about 34 of the way through the movie and then grabbed his stuff and walked out
2015-05-03 16:27:13,47,0,47,Chappie,No People reacted that way to the second Chappie trailer because it featured a condensed version of the whole film into 2 very predictable minutes
2015-05-03 16:30:53,-2,0,-2,Chappie,Chappie was just as good as Interstellar But somehow Interstellar is treated as the second coming on here
2015-05-03 17:47:37,2,0,2,Chappie,Chappie was panned by critics too so its not exclusive to reddit I didnt think Chappie had anything original or special about it  I felt like I had seen it all before and it was very by the numbers
2015-05-03 18:02:42,2,0,2,Chappie,Meanwhile Ex Machina a movie in the same line as Chappie comes out to astounding reviews and nobody on this sub talked about it
2015-05-03 18:56:23,1,0,1,Chappie,I am so tired of this absurd argument  Avatar was garbage IMO literally Fern Gully  Chappie was very original maybe not in its story but in its EXECUTION  Name another film about AI with robots a gritty R rating gangsters and takes place in South Africa not made by Blomkamp  Didnt think so
2015-05-03 19:15:07,0,0,0,Chappie,um clearly chappie dont know what Neil Blomkamp was thinking on that one

2015-05-04 16:12:42,8,0,8,Chappie,And one of the big complaints was that Chappie himself was an irritating dbag which I really dont get He was basically an overly eager child

2015-05-05 13:27:15,1,0,1,Chappie,I am on the other side of this I really enjoyed the film I understand why people did not like the film and initially I was not on board The acting from Yolandi and Ninja Ninja specifically was pretty rough but did get better by the end Chappie as a character was so fascinating to me and was so well done IMO

2015-05-06 20:01:54,2,0,2,Chappie,Thats called good marketing any trailer contractor worth their weight can do that given some footage they dont even need to know what the movie is about and can paint an exciting picture for you Occasionally they get confused and mistakenly create trailers with completely different emotions chappie had this issue so did the movie holes I think it was from years ago Either way if youre still falling for cheap marketing tricks youre going to have a really disappointing future ahead of you

2015-05-07 14:06:55,6,0,6,Chappie,Man I really liked that movie I strongly disliked the last 3 minutes though when they spoilers revived the mom I actually really liked chappie the character it was just a fun overall movie
2015-05-07 15:43:21,26,0,26,Chappie,Chappie was sold as a serious action flick but it was definitely intended to be a comedy
2015-05-07 18:14:16,1,0,1,Chappie,I thought it delivered way more than I expected It had a District 9 feel to it and man when you realize what he Chappie is trying to do it really got going
2015-05-07 21:50:09,0,0,0,Chappie,I was so mad about that In the trailer they actually talk about how a revolution is at hand and how Chappie is their only hope The movie literally had none of that I liked it but it did a disservice to the movie as people were going in thinking they were gonna get District 9 and Chappie wasnt even close aside from also being in South Africa
2015-05-07 23:25:48,2,0,2,Chappie,I get that But what is a child if not a blank slate brought into our world with the ability to reason and think The only advantage chappie had was that his learning happened more quickly This is a great parallel that he is running out of batteries at such a quick rate

2015-05-09 05:44:13,13,0,13,Chappie,Chappie is a great movie dont listen to the critics
2015-05-09 05:50:32,1,0,1,Chappie,Chappie was really hoping Blomkamp had learned from Elysium
2015-05-09 07:11:03,1,0,1,Chappie,Ive heard ExMachina is what chappie was supposed to be
2015-05-09 07:50:50,5,0,5,Chappie,I am real smart I know because I love Chappie which means critics are plebs who only like Michael Bay films and pretentious movies like Boyhood it took 12 years to make It is the only thing about that movie which is unique
2015-05-09 14:32:52,1,0,1,Chappie,Chappie
2015-05-09 17:48:48,3,0,3,Chappie,I feel like Chappie got overhated I went to the cheap seats like a month ago to watch it and it wasnt that bad It was cheesy predictable and definitely inferior to District 9 But as a big fan of Die Antwoord I had a blast watching the movie Underneath the thinly veiled themes I found the movie to be a very hopeful and less pretentious scifi compared to Interstellar Chappie is a movie I thoroughly enjoyed and can see it getting some cult following Especially with its whole science vs religion motif
2015-05-10 00:50:37,2,0,2,Chappie,I enjoyed Chappie Most people I have talked in in real life enjoyed it too
2015-05-10 15:50:43,1,0,1,Chappie,Crappy Chappie is a sloppy wet turd
2015-05-10 19:50:47,0,0,0,Chappie,Chappie was awful
2015-05-11 03:55:34,3,0,3,Chappie,District 9 Chappie Elysium  I watched them in that order the other day  Just seems like the same universe
2015-05-11 09:56:03,1,0,1,Chappie,SchmoesKnow I dont always agree with their ratings Chappie wasnt that bad guys but I love their personalities
2015-05-11 17:08:44,-1,0,-1,Chappie,Instead we need more movies like Chappie or A Doctor Strange movie
2015-05-11 17:56:26,-1,0,-1,Chappie,IMO it would be a better choice to go rent or buy Interstellar or Chappie They are both excellent original scifi films Tired sequels and reboots are so overdone Why release this movie in 3D when it wasnt filmed in 3D The only explanation is greed This whole thread stinks of the marketing of a bad movie
2015-05-11 19:36:18,1,0,1,Chappie,I am all for exciting scifi and action movies geared towards adults but why couldnt we get behind a nonremake maybe something like Ex Machina or Chappie
2015-05-11 20:37:03,8,0,8,Chappie,I get your point but John Wick came out less than a year ago We still get a decent number of Rrated action films every year the problem is that not all of them are very goodI did love Chappie though despite the critics
2015-05-11 23:19:39,2,0,2,Chappie,gtWhere was this post when Chappie was in theaters
2015-05-12 02:40:05,0,0,0,Chappie,I agree elysium was ok havent seen chappie  really hoping for the best with district 10
2015-05-12 17:15:19,2,0,2,Chappie,The hype for this movie did seem pretty over the top on rmovies I got the same impression when Chappie came out
2015-05-12 20:59:21,1,0,1,Chappie,Chappie has Chappie and thats about it
2015-05-14 01:22:31,1,0,1,Chappie,Chappie is the saddest movie I have seen in my entire life
2015-05-14 16:59:11,1,0,1,Chappie,I thought Chappie was sort of going to be that It wont happen because
2015-05-14 18:13:43,1,0,1,Chappie,I just feel that Blomkamp is so hugely into future robotics that it makes perfect sense Chappie actually did have a RoboCop feel if you think of the huge robot as ED209
2015-05-14 18:15:47,1,0,1,Chappie,I think it would be a good match and yes I did get a biiiig ED209 feel from what was it called The Mule or whatever But yeah Blomkamp needs better street cred these days to get his hands on a project like that I would have vastly preferred that to Chappie which I didnt like apart from Why you steal daddys car
2015-05-14 18:21:57,1,0,1,Chappie,I think it was a clever way to show the artificial intelligence and humanize Chappie I also got a slight Short Circuit vibe from the film Johnny 5
2015-05-14 19:09:41,8,0,8,Chappie,He gets shit on more often than not People hated Chappie and Elysium
2015-05-14 19:25:49,1,0,1,Chappie,In the near future crime is patrolled by a mechanized police force When one police droid Chappie is stolen and given new programming he becomes the first robot with the ability to think and feel for himself unfortunately support for Windows XP ended on April 8 2014 and Chappie had some XP vulnerabilities that got exploited so
2015-05-14 20:02:48,4,0,4,Chappie,I liked chappie Its tone was inconsistent but the effects were awesome its themes were smart while still being very accessible and the moose was one of the coolest machines on screen in a while
2015-05-15 06:40:15,1,0,1,Chappie,I know Im WAY WAY behind on the discussion but I just watched it despite the terrible reviews and uh I liked it quite a bit If nothing else its miles ahead of Elysium which I felt was a truly terrible film and I find comparisons made between Chappie and JarJar to be borderline offensive
2015-05-15 13:41:42,1,0,1,Chappie,The scene where Chappie beats Hugh Jackman to the point of death gave me such a justice boner
2015-05-15 18:18:16,1,0,1,Chappie,Originally they wanted to use him to turn off the police droids but upon discovering Chappies parts Deon explains to them that he has developed an AI and that they can use it for the heist but he needs to teach it They agree to let him Yolandi even makes the comment to Ninja that he cant be teaching him that shit yet the nerds gotta orientate him
2015-05-15 21:05:37,-1,0,-1,Chappie,Chappie
2015-05-16 07:38:50,1,0,1,Chappie,I am planing on watching it tomorow night I just watched Chappie and well I am very dissapointed The movie if it were rated pg 13 would be good But it tried to deal with complex sciences and moral without actually going into them Making for a bad over all expirience Not as fine tuned as I would have hoped for a modern day AI movie
2015-05-16 07:45:05,6,0,6,Chappie,Because the pacing was very poor the characters besides Chappie all felt one dimensional the main villainantagonist wasnt that threatening It was a really boring movie
2015-05-16 10:25:30,75,0,75,Chappie,The movie is definitely not shit it does a great job of pacing the story and getting the audience emotionally invested in the fate of chappie and dion by the end It was also nice to see Jackman as a villain for once
2015-05-16 10:27:45,18,0,18,Chappie,I was dragged to see Chappie by a friend Bad reviews and all that
2015-05-16 10:29:05,159,0,159,Chappie,I liked the movie Everything Chappie said was awesome WHY DO YOU STEAL DADDYS CAR
2015-05-16 10:48:20,32,0,32,Chappie,I think its a bad movie overall but its got a lot of good elements going for it I thought it was really good visually Chappies CGI looked awesome and most of the action was well done also Blokmkamp just knows how to make the Johannesburg slums look beautiful Sharlto Copley made Chappie a very entertaining character and I did like Ninja and Yolandi at times The movie had me interested for the first 30 minutes or so but then it just went off in a strange direction and once Hugh Jackmans storyline came in the pacing was just awful It could have done something interesting with the AI conciousness thing  like what Ex Machina did more recently but instead they turned it into a shitty plot device The movie was just a lot of wasted potential for a great SciFi flick
2015-05-16 10:58:10,0,0,0,Chappie,Chappie was the only good character
2015-05-16 11:05:37,25,0,25,Chappie,I felt so bad for Chappie when they left him in the real world but the acting when he came back to YoLandi injured was great Especially when he talked about a bad man in a vansad and funny at the same time
2015-05-16 11:38:14,13,0,13,Chappie,Go to sleepy weepy Love Chappie
2015-05-16 11:38:58,9,0,9,Chappie,My theory on the PS4s and the stacking system for computational purposes the movie was put out by Columbia Pictures which is a Sony company Sony in the past have stated that combined ps4s could be used as a super computer of sortsso yes whilst it was product placement it did sort of make sense I liked it because it showed that Chappie had become more intelligent Ninja just wanted to sell the play stations but Chappie had a different idea
2015-05-16 11:48:23,5,0,5,Chappie,My friend and I both came out of Chappie raving about how much we enjoyed it
2015-05-16 11:48:25,2,0,2,Chappie,Ive gotta say I enjoyed the film but I was far more interested in the Jackman storyline than the actual Chappie one I thought it could have been so much more the whole gangster aspect I just found annoying and boring wanted more of the HumanMachine conflict that I felt was teased every now and then but was left behind in the end
2015-05-16 11:59:52,9,0,9,Chappie,What I loved about the movie was the fact that basically everybody was a bad guy in some sort except chappie jackman was a crazy asshole die antwoord were well themselves and chappie was just trying to struggle through everything without knowing what the fuck was going on Him being portrayed as a small helpless and yet incredibly strong child was really fun to watch I also enjoyed dions character a lot him not being a bad guy but also not really able to help chappie
2015-05-16 12:15:42,1,0,1,Chappie,Yeah Ive heard similar criticism for Chappie Its a shame because when I saw the first trailer I thought it had potential Im still gonna give it a chance though
2015-05-16 12:35:11,3,0,3,Chappie,I remember first seeing the trailer and it said CHAPPIE Official Trailer HD  Hugh Jackman and I was really expecting to see Hugh Jackman in a lead hero role
2015-05-16 12:38:49,-1,0,-1,Chappie,Ive seen them both and didnt connect Chappies brilliance with either of them Though District 9 has the look
2015-05-16 12:39:38,0,0,0,Chappie,The Chappie character reminded me of Jar Jar Binks quite annoying The film is ok could have been much better though
2015-05-16 12:42:36,3,0,3,Chappie,I wanted to like this movie and I didnt think it was shit It started out strong and had a bunch of neat things happening throughout but I do think it ultimately fell apart towards the end much like the character of Chappie himself
2015-05-16 12:43:05,7,0,7,Chappie,Ok  After district 9 I thought Neill Blomkamp was potentially the next great director someone to emulate James Cameron even  But the two films he has made since D9 have shown him to be a one trick pony  Chappie not happie  Elysium was badly written and re hashed a lot of basic ideas from D9 and now Chappie does the same
2015-05-16 12:49:30,26,0,26,Chappie,The dialogue would fail a Screenwriting 101 assignment The moment where Chappie and Ninja are in the van arguing sticks out in my mind They state their motivations explicitly No one does that or should do that in a movie
2015-05-16 13:24:12,1,0,1,Chappie,You didnt care about Chappie at all Any examples on some of the pathetic dialogue
2015-05-16 13:24:53,1,0,1,Chappie,I agree that some of the characters felt plain but I think that Chappie as a character made up for that His whole character arc was great from start to finish
2015-05-16 14:48:58,12,0,12,Chappie,agree with you on everything here i simply dont get how people can say chappie was well written at all there were gaping plot holes which compltely ruined the pace of the movie and ultimately ruined any connection i had with the characters cool cgi some good performances but thats about it
2015-05-16 14:51:22,1,0,1,Chappie,Just YouTube Red Letter Medias Half in the Bag review of Chappie and youll see why it sucked
2015-05-16 14:55:05,-3,0,-3,Chappie,I thought Chappie was a better film
2015-05-16 15:11:08,1,0,1,Chappie,Never didnt have respect I just didnt know what they were or did A loose example is I didnt think Eminem acted in 8 Mile but he did a damn good job and I loved that movie As for these two Now that I know how I pin them down a little better than when I get around to watching Chappie I can at least go in knowing what to expect and quasi judge them on
2015-05-16 15:15:24,2,0,2,Chappie,I watched the movie just yesterday and was fully aware of the critics mostly hating it The ending of the movie almost brought me to tears The movie while cheesy and with some onedimensional characters cough Hugh Jackmans role cough has a heart and a soul Chappie was the most relatable movie robot since WallE and his relationship to Yolandi and Deon was beautiful
2015-05-16 15:30:49,1,0,1,Chappie,Chappie as with Elysium was two script revisions away from a great movie Unfortunately it was plagued by weird dialog and just overall strange characters who made weird decisions I loved the look found Die Antwoord was ok and the action was alright It felt like there was a good movie in there somewhere
2015-05-16 15:32:03,8,0,8,Chappie,Really I thought the writing was awful Some of the lines and delivery was just so unbelievable Character motivations simply didnt make sense And Chappies lines and personality was pretty bad I wasnt enjoying the movie at all until I took my brothers way and starting thinking of it as a comedy way better that way So in the end I liked it but for all the wrong reasons
2015-05-16 15:44:43,9,0,9,Chappie,I dunno it sounded to me exactly how a parent would try and explain something to a child Chappie explicitly states his intentions because hes a child and Ninja explicitly states his because hes talking to his child  thats at least how I saw it
2015-05-16 15:46:52,2,0,2,Chappie,You hit the nail on the head Chappie is the most human character in the movie and everyone around him is a cartoon
2015-05-16 15:52:51,5,0,5,Chappie,It has a very comic book styling to it Even with some awkward moments or where it could have gone a little further with some ideas at the end it was definitely cool how it was executed Much love for Chappie
2015-05-16 16:39:57,2,0,2,Chappie,Just watched it last night  I loved every scene with Chappie and YoLandi  Especially the one where YoLandi and American are first teaching Chappie to talk
2015-05-16 17:34:01,2,0,2,Chappie,I watched it directly after Ex Machina Very interesting to see two completely different takes regarding AI It was a solid film but I feel as if the film shouldve solely focused on Chappies humanistic development instead of the bank heist subplot
2015-05-16 17:35:34,1,0,1,Chappie,I def agree with this Looking back on it now I realize I really only was interested in the parts that included Chappie the second time around
2015-05-16 17:53:31,1,0,1,Chappie,Funnily enough Ex Machina was the last film I watched just before Chappie too I loved both movies
2015-05-16 18:27:03,1,0,1,Chappie,Chappie although the movie itself was bad the storyline dealt with this quite well incorporating human consciousness
2015-05-16 18:41:28,-1,0,-1,Chappie,The movie IS actually shit but no you are not an idiot Chappie was a bad movie completely deserving of all the bad reviewsand yetcompletely enjoyable It was so weird I have never found myself criticizing a movie so much and yet having fun at the same time I think what makes the difference is whether or not you find Chappie endearing or annoying
2015-05-16 18:42:24,1,0,1,Chappie,Well I liked the movie And for the record I liked Elysium too Its interesting to see the trajectory of Blomkamps career from being heralded the second coming of scifi when he made District 9 to becoming nerd pariah with his next two movies I think the downturn happened because people just put this huge weight on him to top D9 and when he couldnt surpass the fans expectations thats when the tide suddenly turned Elysium and Chappie are not perfect by any means but theyre both really solid and highly entertaining scifi movies and Im excited for Neills Alien movie
2015-05-16 19:13:38,1,0,1,Chappie,chappie was ok I feel that Blumcamps best movie was district 9 and I definitely like chappie  more then elysium but his first is still his best
2015-05-16 19:23:11,2,0,2,Chappie,It was bad but watchable Most of the characters were just clichs or just shit except for Chappie who was one of the few standouts of the film the plot was bad and the CGI was amazing
2015-05-16 20:09:41,1,0,1,Chappie,Chappie was the worst Die Antwoord music video Ive ever seen
2015-05-16 20:46:11,1,0,1,Chappie,Chappie has books
2015-05-16 22:06:21,1,0,1,Chappie,The naysayers arent wrong and much of the criticism has real merit That said none of that stopped me for one moment from enjoying the pants off Chappie
2015-05-16 22:21:24,1,0,1,Chappie,I thought it was pretty damn good I liked District 9 and Elysium but was deterred by the bad press from seeing this on release Im disappointed I didnt go see it as its pretty damn good Im a Die Antwood fan also so was pretty stoked about them being in it and their music featured so prominently Special effects were great Chappie was far from short circuit and the motion capture on him was A grade he really had a unique body language and an interesting character
2015-05-16 23:10:28,1,0,1,Chappie,I thought the movie was just unique artists being artists  It took some aspects of its plot seriously but other times just wanted explosions and  of course  to show off Chappie integrated into the world world  The special effects are perfectseamless  and that much of the movie
2015-05-16 23:25:20,2,0,2,Chappie,gt Chappies CGI looked awesome and most of the action was well done also Blokmkamp just knows how to make the Johannesburg slums look beautiful
2015-05-16 23:30:10,1,0,1,Chappie,Chappie was an interesting character but it was the poor acting and utterly dreadful ending that took the film from being okay to bad I have no idea what happened but the end was so rushed they may have had wrote it a minute before shooting Visually it was quite pretty but I hope Alien and Blomkamps future films are written by someone else
2015-05-17 02:05:33,2,0,2,Chappie,You addressed the two comments that caught my attention most VERY WELL  because I do believe Neil has a knack for the slums of Johannesburg and he loves it for his sandbox and he knows how to play there I also love how you put that its fine having both filmns because they deal with AI differently I think ExMachina is one of the best films of the year but chappie was extremely enjoyable and I think anyone who watches it should know about Die Antword before as the film sort of serves as a spiritual music video for them produced by Sony but I really loved it
2015-05-17 02:21:38,3,0,3,Chappie,a homemade chappie shirt
2015-05-17 04:52:56,4,0,4,Chappie,You mean Chappie
2015-05-17 07:08:52,1,0,1,Chappie,Oh yeah no doubt you should I would go into it with an attitude of a an adventure Short circuit style movie of a childhood memory That may flesh out the characters more for you and the story maybe more forgiving But the trailer set me up for the movie I didnt get so I left with a worse opinion that the movie may have My gf like it as she isnt a tech and science person and she enjoyed Chappie and the story more Food for thought
2015-05-17 13:29:26,1,0,1,Chappie,Whats the name of the song when that plays when Chappie is getting trained on how to be a gangsta with Ninja and Yankie
2015-05-17 16:57:38,1,0,1,Chappie,I liked both Chappie and Elysium Not in my top 100 movies May have similar plots but nonetheless very entertaining for me

2015-05-17 20:29:51,2,0,2,Chappie,No they got new bodies with batteries that could be replacedrecharged It was the entire point of him getting a new body Now they can live forever as Chappie specifically put it
2015-05-17 22:34:01,1,0,1,Chappie,yeah but the batteries are only made by the company that wants Chappie death and which they have no access to
2015-05-18 02:04:53,4,0,4,Chappie,Im so glad someone mentioned Chappie I dont understand why so many people didnt liked it I thought it was good
2015-05-18 05:09:39,1,0,1,Chappie,CHAPPIE
2015-05-18 05:18:11,1,0,1,Chappie,Elysium just felt like it was a couple plot changes away from being incredible and that was sort of devastating to my initial feelings about it  However I should probably rewatch it  Chappie is amazing When it ended I loaded up reddit to search for the Chappie thread just to see people talk more about it
2015-05-18 05:22:48,1,0,1,Chappie,Chappie probably had some feels about Yolandi that ties back into the doll and likely the desire to give her an upgraded body
2015-05-18 05:26:24,2,0,2,Chappie,Daddys journey from must use this metal death machine to wow I was a total asshole to Chappie and I totally deserved that ass kicking was a nice journey
2015-05-18 12:05:44,1,0,1,Chappie,Seeing it tomorrow Have seen Avengers It Follows Kumiko the Treasure Hunter Ex Machina Fifty Shades of Grey Furious 7 Spongebob 2 Cinderella Chappie and Unfriended though Kingsmans still my favorite probably followed by Kumiko and Ex Machina
2015-05-18 12:57:00,1,0,1,Chappie,Saw Chappie and was pleasantly surprised Went in without seeing trailers or reading about it completely blind Would recommend it
2015-05-18 14:11:44,2,0,2,Chappie,Havent watched the new Mad Max and Fast Furious but these other movies along with Chappie and John Wick came out this January in my country would be in my top 5 so far
2015-05-18 14:54:33,2,0,2,Chappie,Well Ive only seen 2 so far P Chappie and Age of Ultron I loved Chappie lt3
2015-05-18 16:43:15,28,0,28,Chappie,Chappie was great though
2015-05-18 16:49:39,64,0,64,Chappie,He didnt understand Chappie thus art Good reasoning
2015-05-18 17:19:29,2,0,2,Chappie,Ex Machina It Follows Lost River and Chappie
2015-05-18 17:28:14,25,0,25,Chappie,It really was I preferred district 9 but chappie the movie was still pretty damn fun and I rooted for chappie the robot the whole time
2015-05-18 17:34:29,3,0,3,Chappie,I liked chappie
2015-05-18 18:24:37,-1,0,-1,Chappie,So Allowed to have opinionsI liked Chappie
2015-05-18 18:36:43,9,0,9,Chappie,Yes  The official rmovies chappie discussion made it seem like people here generally liked it as well Critics certainly didnt though
2015-05-18 21:34:09,0,0,0,Chappie,I actually really enjoyed Chappie  It had some flaws but what movie doesnt  I really didnt understand the copious amounts of hate
2015-05-18 22:38:30,1,0,1,Chappie,The Heroes Journey aspect was evident right away I felt it watched like a Greek Epic read I actually had no desire to see Chappie but thanks to you I will give it a go
2015-05-19 00:46:26,1,0,1,Chappie,Hes obviously passionate about it so I hold out hope Though I paid to see chappie at the movies against all my better judgement and all the evidence I still hold out hope Dont fuck this up Blomkamp
2015-05-19 01:51:53,3,0,3,Chappie,I LOVED Chappie the character The movie as a whole though could have been a lot better Less Mama Antwoord please

2015-05-19 04:58:48,-1,0,-1,Chappie,Chappie was garbage Just an excuse to put Ninja and Yolandi in a movie Seriously that was the entire motivation for the film One dimensional characters stupid shit like the helmet thing that could read brainwaves but magically also Chappies processors I guess just fucking dumb lacking in focus and zero character development
2015-05-19 11:33:28,0,0,0,Chappie,whatever that crap was for Chappie
2015-05-19 11:48:27,1,0,1,Chappie,I really hope miller doesnt make a Chappie
2015-05-19 13:57:35,1,0,1,Chappie,Chappie
2015-05-19 14:12:06,5,0,5,Chappie,Nope loved this Die Antwood was the best part of Chappie
2015-05-19 14:16:02,1,0,1,Chappie,Watch Ex MachinaChappie double bill   Thats what i did   Both about AI but completely different
2015-05-20 04:09:28,2,0,2,Chappie,It was a step up from Elysium but still streets behind District 9 Chappie as a character was great however
2015-05-20 04:50:11,-1,0,-1,Chappie,Saw it in theaters opening day Loved District 9 and Elysium absolutely hated Chappie
2015-05-20 04:56:23,0,0,0,Chappie,A robot being raised by a pack of retards is attacked by an Australian Saturday morning cartoon villain that would make the corpse of Steve Irwin rotisserie in his grave Seriously fuck Chappie
2015-05-20 05:10:37,1,0,1,Chappie,The pacing and the overall story arc were actually pretty good Chappie was pretty awesome but needed a little more development I felt like they were way off on the other characters way too flamboyant for most audiences and some of the set and color design and it really weakened the movie It has the potential to be a great franchiseuniverse just needs a little more refining
2015-05-20 05:26:15,1,0,1,Chappie,Disjointed thematically inconsistent just terrible acting from too many people that it compounds on itself incredibly dumb turn of events Chappie brain scanning himself into another robot just becausethings Huge Jackmans perfunctory Catholicism that is used for nothing Yolandis materialism utterly wasted just a wasted opportunity for what is essentially a dog and pony show of effects and cinematography all this and more a movie does not make
2015-05-20 06:24:17,9,0,9,Chappie,Im thinking we dodged a bullet after seeing Elysium and Chappie
2015-05-20 09:35:37,0,0,0,Chappie,The scene where they teach Chappie to walk and talk like a gangster
2015-05-20 13:13:37,2,0,2,Chappie,I thought Chappie was OK Deffinately not what I expectedbut I cant knock it for that
2015-05-20 13:29:14,1,0,1,Chappie,Nope I love Chappie Its probably my favorite release of 2015 so far
2015-05-20 14:02:58,-3,0,-3,Chappie,I read all the reviews and got super hyped Took my wife to see it and was disappointed I cant pinpoint what it is either I just didnt find it as exhilarating as everyone else does I honestly thought ChappIe was a more exciting action movie
2015-05-20 17:49:55,1,0,1,Chappie,But I love how it still made us nervous whenever he bullied Chappie even when Chappie can clobber him easily
2015-05-20 18:47:52,2,0,2,Chappie,Elysium and Chappie
2015-05-20 19:17:02,2,0,2,Chappie,Just watched Chappie for the first time the other night I loved it Action humor heart wrenching scenes plot twists I was engaged through the whole movie
2015-05-20 20:31:12,5,0,5,Chappie,I still think that the idea behind chappie was pretty damn interesting But damn Ive never seen anyone ruin a movie as hard as die antvoord did
2015-05-20 21:53:24,1,0,1,Chappie,I liked them but yeah not as good as D9  Elysium felt hollow and Chappie had little bits of greatness but ultimately fell flat Still a Blomkamp fan I think he hell make some great films in the future
2015-05-21 01:04:36,1,0,1,Chappie,Ooooh I just watched Ex Machina and Chappie that sounds interesting as hell
2015-05-21 13:29:26,2,0,2,Chappie,I love Chappie Sleepyweepy D
2015-05-21 23:54:02,1,0,1,Chappie,Chappie is awesome but its not as serious or thought provoking as Ex Machina
2015-05-22 09:39:42,3,0,3,Chappie,I loved Chappie Ex Machina and Mad Max Was disappointed that I missed It Follows in theaters The Avengers was good but I didnt feel like it was essential
2015-05-23 03:40:12,1,0,1,Chappie,Here goes the Link  httpwwwmovie8kusmovie31054watchchappieonlinemovie8k
2015-05-23 17:49:04,1,0,1,Chappie,Damon taught me to never trust Neill Blomkamp in space And Chappie taught me to never trust Neill Blomkamp again
2015-05-23 21:29:26,11,0,11,Chappie,Chappie is a classic scifi movie already
2015-05-23 23:22:09,5,0,5,Chappie,Chappie Pacific Rim and WallE are classic What year is it
2015-05-24 00:04:53,3,0,3,Chappie,Its more of a classic than PR or Chappie but I still consider it a little too recent but its one of the best of Pixar
2015-05-24 04:48:45,1,0,1,Chappie,I have seen it in a normal theater for Avengers Mall Cop Tomorrowland and Chappie Actually getting annoyed at the trailer because I know I will be seeing it until December for every movie it seems
2015-05-24 18:49:24,3,0,3,Chappie,Surprised no one has said this yet Chappie it was such a well made movie Looked and felt great Great story definitely the surprise movie of the last few years for me I looked up some of the music from the movie most of it is by this south African group who are also in the movie Pretty bad ass Ive been telling everyone to see it
2015-05-24 20:00:07,1,0,1,Chappie,Chappie Thoroughly enjoyed the hell out of it It was nothing like I expected
2015-05-24 23:27:55,-4,0,-4,Chappie,I would have seen Mad Max if the critics werent bribed If Warner Brothers is going to be stupid enough to think Im going to fall for that stunt theyre jokers No action film ever just gets 5 bad reviews especially a violent mindless POS like Mad Max I saw how they trashed Chappie and Die Hard 5 two highly entertaining films then raved about John Wick and Fury two horrible pieces of shit Theyre totally on the take and its shameless
2015-05-25 09:14:38,1,0,1,Chappie,Chappie wasnt expecting it to be that funny
2015-05-25 16:32:56,-2,0,-2,Chappie,I would like to see Chappie redone by Ridley Scott but with WAY less emphasis on Die Antwoord and melodrama but with the solitary experience of Chappie as he discovers his sentience and understands his life around him A story in the likes of Blade Runner as Chappie discovers his humanity
2015-05-26 00:32:35,1,0,1,Chappie,ive seen it horrible rip off of ridley scotts newest movie Chappie 2012
2015-05-26 03:43:38,3,0,3,Chappie,In Chappie they used a bunch of SonyTM PlaystationTM 4 to build a supercomputer to transfer their consciousness to I almost walked out
2015-05-26 03:48:34,-12,0,-12,Chappie,Wouldnt be surprised if that fell through after Chappie was a disappointment
2015-05-26 04:11:31,2,0,2,Chappie,Chappie was great goddammit
2015-05-26 04:30:03,-3,0,-3,Chappie,You lost me at stupid Die Antwoord morons Sorry Im a fan of theirs and have been for a few years now Also the movie was chockfull of Robocop homages the original Tetra Vaal short film made pre District 9 was basically Neill making his personal version of what Robocop would be like in JoBurg and Robocop is my alltimefavorite film We like diff things thats fine I also thought him pulling the gun then offering a church invitation was a great laughoutloud moment for the film to release the pressure just after that intense scene Anyways the Robocop references made the lessawesome parts worth it for me anyways The Moose was basically Ed209 the Scouts other than Chappie pretty much sounded exactly like Robocop even so much as to speak lines directly from the influential film Patel and Jackman were basically the Ferrer and Cox characters from Robocop with Weaver in the role of The Old Man CEO of the supercorporation running the police dept Most of the big complaints about the movie seem to be from people who hate Ninja and Yo Landi Thats fine theyre a little out there but I loved that they were basically themselves and even got to design their hideout on their own It made it feel real Blomkampp has incredible details that make everything feel like real life when were looking at CG more than a lot of much more expensive movies do The Scouts especially Chappie has much better realistic movement and lighting than any of the Transformers do in Bays films and those cost much much more Chappie was an homage to Robocop and I havent mentioned Short Circuit but definitely that as well and if you dont dig that then you dont dig that Its whatevs
2015-05-26 05:34:25,17,0,17,Chappie,Chappie made twice its budget at the box office Bit far from a disappointment there
2015-05-26 05:39:35,-7,0,-7,Chappie,But Chappies critical response kind of showed that Blomkamp might be a one hit wonder  The critical reception from his last three movies went from positive to mixed to negative
2015-05-26 05:40:31,11,0,11,Chappie,Yup People on here seem to think if I dont like it then it was the worst thing ever but both Chappie and Elysium did very well for themselves compared to their budgets
2015-05-26 05:47:41,1,0,1,Chappie,Chappie
2015-05-26 06:33:10,8,0,8,Chappie,I didnt go see Chappie because of the hate it got on the internet saw it recently and thought it was great Blomkamp seems to be a magnet for internet resentment District 9 was great but it was closer to transformers than it was to Citizen Kane like many make it out to be Elysium was great also it pressed some political buttons in the US as D9 did in South Africa with its themes of social inequality and the right to healthcare Chappie while not overly political embraced South Africa as a modern backdrop much as D9 Im a fan of Die Antwood and the movie was an awesome 130 ZEF video
2015-05-26 06:35:44,3,0,3,Chappie,District 9 Ex Machina Chappie Sunshine Moon Elysium Interstellar Predator The Thing 1982 Apollo 13 Galaxy Quest Guardians of the Galaxy Star WarsDuh Planet of the Apes Gravity Close Encounters of the Third Kind 2001 A Space Odyssey WallE Star Trek The Wrath of Khan Star Trek2009 Contact Solaris Serenity
2015-05-26 06:49:24,4,0,4,Chappie,The studios dont care about the reviews as long as the movie makes a lot of money And although D9 definitely is his best movie I enjoyed both Chappie and Elysium as solid scifiaction flicks
2015-05-26 07:15:12,1,0,1,Chappie,Well Wikus couldnt come back since he never left But it would be cool to see CJ return and see how humanity has still not advanced mentally Then you could even though in Chappie and Elysium connection since I consider them all same world Chappie then District 9 then Elysium
2015-05-26 09:15:22,2,0,2,Chappie,I think its an individual projectionist error because Ive seen this happen a few times but Mad Max was fine Chappie was so jagged when I saw it it looked like a PS1 game
2015-05-26 13:57:00,5,0,5,Chappie,And I enjoyed both I loved Chappie actually
2015-05-26 14:07:57,3,0,3,Chappie,Chappie was fantastic It was absolute lunacy
2015-05-26 15:02:15,1,0,1,Chappie,No mention just my own opinion since they all seem to revolve around Third world over population scenarios Chappie and D9 being both in South Africa IMU would not have released anything because after the events of Chappie the destruction could possibly have led go less of a robot present at least for some time Maybe D9 could come before as well thus Chappie would be the construction of robot defense in the case of another alien problem
2015-05-26 16:01:33,1,0,1,Chappie,Chappie had a good one but thats more central to the movie and Unforgiven had a beautiful one if you think about it
2015-05-26 18:01:07,3,0,3,Chappie,I dont know Chappie felt a lot like D9 to me
2015-05-26 21:33:59,5,0,5,Chappie,Chappie
2015-05-26 22:56:37,1,0,1,Chappie,Did Chappie get hate on the Net
2015-05-27 02:22:58,1,0,1,Chappie,I want to see it because what I thought of the teaser and the poster was this is porbably what Chappie was meant to be But its not out yet here
2015-05-27 04:00:29,2,0,2,Chappie,The movie was alright but Caleb was hopelessly naive from the beginning and I could tell I could not believe he thought he actually had some sort of connection with the AI or how people watching it thought that Ive seen people say they thought they were in love It was all very predictable Overall I didnt think it was anything close groundbreaking or amazing I actually saw Chappie in the same week and enjoyed that much more
2015-05-27 04:17:56,1,0,1,Chappie,I thought Chappie was alright but it really wasnt anything special Not a bad movie at all but it wasnt that great either
2015-05-27 04:50:55,2,0,2,Chappie,I felt like if you liked District 9 and Elysium then you would like Chappie All 3 movies are pretty similar
2015-05-27 05:03:14,-6,0,-6,Chappie,Lets not We already DID talk about Chappie when it came out what feels like 6 months ago now
2015-05-27 06:13:07,1,0,1,Chappie,Only applies because they were in Chappie but I never want to meet Die Antwoords Ninja and Yolandi Ive seen them perform twice and even then I was too close I like their music but somehow I dont think we exactly have comparable world views
2015-05-27 06:18:57,2,0,2,Chappie,Loved it Most of my friends didnt so much but I loved it Granted Jackman was over the top and a few things bothered me in regards to the plot but it was so much fun and Chappie and Yolandi were just so cool
2015-05-27 09:35:31,-1,0,-1,Chappie,One of the most boring movies i have ever seen go see chappie it is so much better
2015-05-27 10:27:11,1,0,1,Chappie,It was really good Chappie was crap compared to it
2015-05-27 11:47:14,1,0,1,Chappie,I feel there were so many good aspects about it I wanted to love Chappie but I wanted to see more character development of the artificial intelligence  something I just didnt feel was explored enough Still enjoyable to watch though
2015-05-27 12:18:39,3,0,3,Chappie,Lol he states why he designed the bot specifically for the guy AI definitely is more advanced than humans but the ability to learn is what was left in Ava she was stuck in a glass box faced with decision making with only her conscience thoughts Chappie was the same way the robot had to learn
2015-05-27 12:55:16,5,0,5,Chappie,I thought Chappiehttpmanapopcomfilmchappie2015review was a mess  The effects were about the only thing good about it as the script made little to no sense
2015-05-27 13:30:31,1,0,1,Chappie,For me Chappie started off very well with the following dramatic questions
2015-05-27 15:34:09,3,0,3,Chappie,As long as he can get a solid writing editor I think he will be fine  I thought Chappie was fine though  I didnt have any expectations after being let down by Elysium  I wanted that to be so good
2015-05-27 15:38:34,-7,0,-7,Chappie,This movie was not deep and it didnt explore any resonant themes The world was empty and devoid of life and it was just a one off movie that will not be remembered greatly We got the guy from ten things I hate about you and the guy from Fred not the best actors from both movies mind you Meh performances shit twist and relatively shallow plot This movie made AI seem like mad max in comparison This is a great movie if you have never ever seen any SciFi before or robot movie ever before Ghost in the shell the matrix and even fuckin chappie had more to say about robots and people and even AI and what matters when it comes to telling them apart Or fuckin blade runner Ex Machina only has 90 on rotten tomatoes because RT is advertising for it Look at all the scores for movies they advertise What a joke
2015-05-27 15:43:28,4,0,4,Chappie,Chappie is his best film to date
2015-05-27 16:01:19,1,0,1,Chappie,Chappie is SciFi but otherwise unrelated to District 9
2015-05-27 16:08:54,2,0,2,Chappie,Blomkamp is a solid director but he needs to completely rework his storytelling techniques District 9 was fantastic Elysium was a bit of a letdown if only because of the massive hype surrounding it and Chappie was passable but still a significant downgrade from his first and even second pictures
2015-05-27 16:28:17,0,0,0,Chappie,I agree Chappie gt D9
2015-05-27 16:29:56,2,0,2,Chappie,I just watched Chappie as well and it was terrible The most unlikable main characters and I was actively rooting for them to die The leads could not act at all and it drags the film down Chappie is a remarkable creation for sure but it was just so predictable and it really bummed me out I loved District 9 and thought Elysium was pretty good but I have lots of issues with it
2015-05-27 22:05:53,1,0,1,Chappie,I actually really liked Elysium unlike most  Still need to see Chappie so I still have some hopes for it
2015-05-27 22:54:44,1,0,1,Chappie,Hell no Are you kidding me comparing the guy who made lady in the water and avatar to elysium and chappie
2015-05-28 02:50:22,0,0,0,Chappie,I feel this had better build up to chappie being uploaded to the net and taking the name ultron The way the humans treated humans he not understand why and then mommy being killed
2015-05-28 03:24:55,9,0,9,Chappie,Same with Chappie Blomf just needs another writer
2015-05-28 19:30:38,1,0,1,Chappie,A new movie Chappie
2015-05-28 19:34:49,1,0,1,Chappie,I still ended up loving chappie but I think they switched the story line part way through Even the description of the movie the day before it released said something like how the police were tyrants basically
2015-05-29 02:23:00,1,0,1,Chappie,Just saw it and I was wondering the whole time why Nathan drank so much Then I saw recordings Caleb pulled up Nathan is dealing with the guilt of killing so many conscious beings he created Up until Ava left Caleb behind I felt like theyd escape together and some sort of happiness would happen but nope The entire film felt off Something was always fucked up Nathan was not nearly as bad bad as we thought and once again Frankensteins monster killed its creator I just watched Chappie too and while it kind of explored similar ideas the outcome was the exact opposite Good to see movies exploring the singularity I had hoped Transcendence would be as good as these two but it was still a good cautionary tale overall
2015-05-29 07:11:37,4,0,4,Chappie,I just watched Chappie first and very unnecessary death is the black guy If I were a terrible person id link tvtropes but Im not so I wont
2015-05-29 08:20:36,7,0,7,Chappie,I was thinking about Chronicle as I was inserting caveats into my comment  I havent finished Chappie because it isnt good but Im not surprised
2015-05-29 15:17:41,-1,0,-1,Chappie,At least it was better than Chappie
2015-05-29 15:29:47,5,0,5,Chappie,Chappie was pretty bad but Chappie the character was actually done very well and at least fun to watch But i didnt pay to see it in the  theater so maybe id be annoyed if i had spent actual money on it
2015-05-29 15:37:24,2,0,2,Chappie,See I actually liked Chappie better I expected just an action film but enjoyed the story much more than I thought I would
2015-05-29 15:39:47,1,0,1,Chappie,Chappie could have been good however it may be the stupidest film Ive ever seen just through sheer volume of ridiculous  ideas detailed throughout
2015-05-29 15:47:49,0,0,0,Chappie,Just go watch chappie again  Movie was awesome
2015-05-29 15:48:52,1,0,1,Chappie,Id have watched Tomorrowland if it werent for Fury Road being in the cinema on the same day as well Glad I didnt watch Tomorrowland from the looks of it although theres a pretty high chance Id have still enjoyed it hell I enjoyed Chappie
2015-05-29 16:28:41,0,0,0,Chappie,At no point in Chappie were the characters anything but horribly acted one dimensional caricatures  Ninja and Yolandi gave performances worthy of a summer camp theatre production trumped only by the laughable literally writing for Weaver and Jackman  That movie was a joke mixed in with wonderful CG  The only thing I could think was that they did it on purpose  Nobody could produce something that horrible and not know it So assuming they did it on purpose why
2015-05-29 17:01:00,2,0,2,Chappie,gtAt no point in Chappie were the characters anything but horribly acted one dimensional caricatures
2015-05-29 18:06:14,1,0,1,Chappie,I dont know the exact numbers but it seems like original films have been on the rise in the last few years Granted the quality varies but off the top of my head Grand Budapest Hotel Tomorrowland Ex Machina John Wick  The Raid Redemption Unfriended Frozen Transcendence Earth to Echo Interstellar Chappie The Man with the Iron Fists Green Inferno Tammy Jupiter Ascending Pixels The Hateful Eight etc Like I said varying quality and I guess success but mostly successful
2015-05-29 18:16:10,1,0,1,Chappie,Did Chappie do well I know noone who saw it and heard no buzz but it was great
2015-05-29 18:47:55,1,0,1,Chappie,I loved Chappie and that has a 30 on Rotten Tomatoes Fuck reviews

2015-05-30 13:00:50,4,0,4,Chappie,Im surprised Chappie hasnt been mentioned It was an awesome movie imo the critics had no idea what they were talking about I wish it had done better in the box office
2015-05-30 17:31:14,0,0,0,Chappie,Add Chappie to that
2015-05-30 17:48:39,6,0,6,Chappie,chappie no get the monies
2015-05-31 01:04:09,2,0,2,Chappie,Theyre different movies though arent they Ex Machina is meant to make you think Chappie is meant to make you feel
2015-05-31 02:10:33,5,0,5,Chappie,I have not seen Chappie didnt look like something Id like but I actually enjoyed Elysium Sure it wasnt perfect but still a good movie I just think the concept of District 9 was the best so far
2015-05-31 02:12:25,7,0,7,Chappie,Chappie was amazing and Elysium was good too  Not sure what you are talking about
2015-05-31 02:40:00,0,0,0,Chappie,Elysium was bad w social commentary Chappie was just bad I wanted to like them as I loved D9 but sadly didnt
2015-05-31 02:59:49,22,0,22,Chappie,I loved Chappie So To each their own
2015-05-31 03:16:19,2,0,2,Chappie,Yeah I felt like if you liked District 9 you would probably like Elysium and Chappie I agree District 9 is the best but all 3 are so similar
2015-05-31 04:29:21,2,0,2,Chappie,In what ways was Chappie amazing
2015-05-31 04:59:36,4,0,4,Chappie,Well each movie is shot in similar fashion Looks wise each movie feels like they could take place in the same world and Im pretty sure they technically do all Three being shot in south Africa Neill Blomkamp has his own style down pat thats for sure Action sequences special effects weapons the robots in Elysium and chappie All feel the same His main characters in his movies all tend to be running from something and hiding out The thing about district 9 was it had a complete beginning middle and end with very little flaws in the entire movie For me I still think about that ending time to time Poor Wikus
2015-05-31 05:07:16,1,0,1,Chappie,Because your to busy pissing your pants of shitty reboots and movies like Chappie
2015-05-31 05:15:17,0,0,0,Chappie,Honestly I didnt like Chappie that much particularly the third act but I didnt think it was any worse than Elysium which has 68 on RT Chappie has 30
2015-05-31 09:20:40,0,0,0,Chappie,Hes overblown his premises with Elysium and Chappie Both films could have a powerful message to them and I suppose they do but he just made to too simple so everyone can get it right away
2015-05-31 10:14:36,1,0,1,Chappie,i didnt like chappie aswellbut im stoked in him doing alien 5
2015-05-31 12:07:27,3,0,3,Chappie,It was a fluke I loved District 9 okay with Elysium hated Chappie Theyre all kind of similar but District 9 was the least flawed in execution The flaws of Chappie like the preachiness or the poor dialogue or the bad acting or the inconsistent tone all definitely could have been flaws with D9 but for whatever reason That reason possibly being Peter Jackson they werent
2015-05-31 17:56:36,3,0,3,Chappie,Only movie I watched this week was Chappie It was no District 9 as in it wasnt thoughtprovoking but it was still thoroughly entertaining
2015-05-31 18:03:08,4,0,4,Chappie,Chappie was a beautiful commentary on the human condition consciousness God and our understanding or lack there of of how they are connected Also sick ass gangsta robot fuck mother
2015-05-31 18:29:15,3,0,3,Chappie,That movie let me down so much I just watched Ex Machina and god damn that was exactly what I needed after watching Chappie Honestly Chappie was just a cartoon pretending to be something more
2015-05-31 20:39:16,1,0,1,Chappie,CHAPPiE
2015-05-31 22:03:28,1,0,1,Chappie,Now watch Chappie Chappie is brilliant District 9 had a great original premise but Chappie is a better written film
2015-05-31 22:06:48,1,0,1,Chappie,CHAPPiE i thought it was a really cool movie its kinda like district 9 same director but about a robot with artificial intelligence

2015-05-01 00:42:59,6,0,6,Animals,Asimovs rules serve only to protect humans from their own creation  The 3rd rule specifically is very unnatural to most any living creature  Creatures will almost always preserve their own existence or the existence of their family like kind or other important figures in their life and very rarely on the contingency that it cannot harm another species  We exhaust countless organic species animals and even other humans sometimes without reason at all but often for reasons of survival  I would argue in order to make a true sentient AI the 3rd rule must be modified although as the film and many other scifi stories and writers warn this is ultimately the cause of the singularity  Seems Nathan did think this was important and likely even foreshadowed in his own dialog knew of his own deathmurder

2015-05-11 00:35:14,1,0,1,Animals,The best film I saw this week was the 2014 Festival de Cannes Prize un Certain Regard winner White God   For those  who havent seen or heard about it think of it as a cross between Lassie Come Home White Fang and Thirteen set in a contemporary Budapest that evokes the LA of Blade Runner directed by Quentin Tarantinos  long lost Hungarian twin  The plot is a bit like Disneys The Aristocats but with 300 or so real live dogs  This aint no fuckin Disney toon  Its one of the most disturbing films I have ever seen  Some have written it off as a failed film that was at its best when it tried to be a B grade horror film  The NY Times gave it strongly positive review that entirely missed what my collegeage daughter and I saw when we watched it  This is a multilayered film that could be read simply as a horrific dog story paralleled with a young girls coming of age story  On a second and predictably uninteresting level its an animal rights story  What my daughter and I but few if any reviewers saw was a 21st century allegory of modern Europe  In the movie the government taxes mongrels and lets people own purebred Hungarian dogs the AKC recognizes Vizlas Komondok and Pulik as Hungarian breeds tax free pretty much the opposite of the way dog rescue really works  She and I believe the stray dogs in the movie represent the African and Asian immigrants who appear in Hungary and other European nations looking for a new home  My daughter suggests that showing the atrocities humans commit on animals is the filmmakers way of making their political point to an audience that is desensitized to the atrocities humans perpetrate against other humans

2015-05-19 03:42:24,60,0,60,Animals,A good zooaquarium can do so many great things for animals and the people who enjoy them  Most professionals who work at these places have dedicated their lives to learning and understanding more and more about these animals in the hopes of helping them thrive in both captivity and the wild There are bad zoosaquariums and some have made mistakes in the past and will probably make some in the future but the overall goal of any halfway decent zooaquarium is preservation of nature and knowledge of those in it

2015-05-21 15:57:51,1,0,1,Animals,My favorite is how they go out of their way to add dialog to tell us that Gravity is stronger on Earth then it is on their new home planet that the lead character is actually weaker here then he would be back at home and then moments later he outruns superevolved wild animals and then eventually decides to fly

2015-05-23 20:10:04,2,0,2,Animals,Lol  Honestly my opinion of the film took an even quicker hit than the fridge  Literally the opening image of the groundhogs or whatever they were  Spielberg said before the movie came out that they avoided unnecessary CGI and basically used it only when needed  I felt like I was slapped across my face when I see 100 unnecessary animals CGId  into the opening shot
2015-05-23 20:43:13,93,0,93,Animals,This is without a doubt the worst fucking criticism of a movie Ive ever fucking heard Lets imagine for a moment that animals dont respond to sound by looking to see what is making it It wouldnt have fucking mattered anyway If she didnt yell she still would have kicked the mother fucker out of a window I imagine she was just doing it to prevent it from biting her dad first
2015-05-23 20:59:31,149,0,149,Animals,How is that bad writing You do realise dinosaurs have fucking ears right And that animals listen for sound when hunting
2015-05-23 21:41:00,6,0,6,Animals,Everybody knows that pack animals always pick the most rational methods towards reaching their goals which are always centered around killing and eating things that arent them  Thats just common sense
2015-05-23 22:00:32,1,0,1,Animals,Well they almost comply with no animals were harmed in the making of this movie
2015-05-23 22:26:31,5,0,5,Animals,Yeah thats a genre that definitely has its niche but I dont think it would work for Jurassic Park A big part of the terror and power of the dinosaurs is their seeming invincibility If they were slaughtered by heavy artillery it would break the illusion and make people realize theyre just animals
2015-05-23 22:47:44,0,0,0,Animals,Because a predator isnt going to swivel its entire head five feet away from its prey to look for the source of a noise like in a cartoon Animals just listen to sound without staring at it Otherwise youre suggesting they could have kept it occupied for hours by spreading to opposite ends of the cabin and yelling its name in sequence to dissorient it It ignores random noises to eat things

2015-05-24 08:06:05,1,0,1,Animals,not really Lol worthy your argument is not sound Any animal is going to check out the big object making sounds coming at it fast whilst being in its peripheral vision In some cases animals will react to sound more that bloody sight take cats for example doing one of the few sounds they like will usually make them investigate whether its in its hunt or not And then look how quickly they react when theyre in the attack pose creeping up towards something but then see they or hear another cat running up towards it seems to bring them out of hunt pretty quick and in to fightflee mode

2015-05-24 17:22:51,2,0,2,Animals,If I recall correctly the first novel has the air force obliterate the island without a problem I think the movies hit the problem of realistically guns will shred through animals rockets will destroy them and if you see drool falling you wont look up slowly but open fire with everything youe got However as mentioned above that ruins the mystique of the animals

2015-05-25 16:41:15,1,0,1,Animals,Im pretty sure the movies inaccurately portray that Were apex predators in large groups but there are plenty of animals that can kill a single human and a pack of raptors would actually have pretty good odds of taking out an equally sized group of random humans unless given a lot of time to prepare Human vs raptor is irrelevant though because the instincts are developed based on the animals ancestors food chain which neither humans nor raptors ancestors were

2015-05-26 04:07:32,26,0,26,Animals,From what I understand and I know little Australias isolated nature makes introducing certain animals and their issues into the environment dangerous because they can take over or cause a ton of problems before theyre checked Of course they can also keep out issues easier and have the ability and desire to try to do so
2015-05-26 04:38:28,13,0,13,Animals,Also it should be noted in general beyond the general ecological issues of not checking foreign animals that both Australia amp New Zealand are known for that fact they are currently officially anyway Rabies free

2015-05-31 12:47:39,1,0,1,Animals,This will probably be an unpopular comment but I have to say Jurassic Park and The Lost World both failed to me Dont get me wrong Im a huge fan of both theyre my two favorite movies of all time But in preparation for Jurassic World Ive just finished reading them both again for the millionth time and I have to say that every time I read the books I get just a little more disappointed in the movies This goes double for The Lost World I really wish they stayed a lot closer to the book But even with Jurassic Park there are just so many scenes that I really wish made it into the movie The juvenile Rex and the raptor attack on the lodge to name a few Particularly one of the whole main story threads was the uncontrolled breeding of the animals and their escaping to the mainland on the supply boat and the failure of the parks systems to detect this I was really disappointed for this whole thread to be essentially removed with only that one scene where Grant and the kids find the eggs left Still my favorite movie of all time but still think it could have been so much better
2015-05-31 17:22:23,100,0,100,Animals,The Jokers entire theme in the movie was trying to prove that people are predictable animals and relying on that fact This is evidenced in a number of scenes between how Gamble and the other crime bosses behaved how he knew Batman would save the girl first and how he was pretty sure Harvey wouldnt shoot him The only time things didnt work out the way he had anticipated was with the boat passengers Everything else he said and did was calculated and worked in his favor
2015-05-31 18:00:08,1,0,1,Animals,We are all animals my dear
2015-05-31 19:26:26,4,0,4,Animals,From all the trailers and Pratts character it seems like at least a part of the theme will be our relationship with animals I know its not a popular opinion here but I think thats a pretty exciting thought to build off of Especially when said animals are dinosaurs
2015-05-31 22:28:27,2,0,2,Animals,great movie that addresses some of the questions raised and being raised about the creation of AI I specifically am stuck on the scene where Nathan says something to the effect of you feel sorry for her feel sorry for yourself man one day the AIs will look back on us like we view fossils on the African plain with rudimentary technology and language a lot of my thoughts about society are now plagued with this concept that we really are just animals with one foot out of the jungle yet still burdened with chemical emotions and driven by vice
2015-05-31 23:31:00,13,0,13,Animals,Because time is money and you can get in more showings if you dont have an intermission Also movie goers are animals Theyd never get back in to theater in a timely fashion
2015-05-01 06:09:42,2,0,2,Tomorrowland,I believe your reply and DarthSunshines is the most helpful I just came back from my screening in Georgia at a Carmike I watched the 2D and got Tomorrowland and AntMan as stated Also Fantastic Four Terminator Jurassic  Selfless and Pixels I work at th theater also and now there are some lazy folk who deal with projection ingestion and blah But Im watching the 3D on Monday so hopefully its in front of that onethe Star Wars I mean
2015-05-01 09:48:17,1,0,1,Tomorrowland,We didnt get a Star Wars trailer we got a tomorrowland trailer instead
2015-05-01 15:39:12,47,0,47,Tomorrowland,Im in Canada we got Jurassic World and an IMAX preview of Tomorrowland Pretty pissed there was no Star Wars
2015-05-01 15:42:00,6,0,6,Tomorrowland,I got Star Wars Jurassic Park and Tomorrowland in Norway Since the full Star Wars trailer is online I think its pretty weird movie theaters dont include it
2015-05-01 15:54:59,407,0,407,Tomorrowland,I will actually I think itll be big but I wonder how long the tail is It starts getting some market competition from Tomorrowland Jurassic World and Inside Out soon Odd that Disney would put out competing products so close to their star summer movie
2015-05-01 16:00:17,258,0,258,Tomorrowland,Tomorrowland I think wont even come close and Ive never even heard of Inside Out Jurassic World may give it some competition but by that time Avengers will have already done all of its heavy hitting and then some
2015-05-01 16:09:24,182,0,182,Tomorrowland,I got Tomorrowland and AntMan and thats it Kind of a bummer
2015-05-01 16:11:42,31,0,31,Tomorrowland,Inside Out is Pixar Pixar usually does very well at the Box Office I think Tomorrowland will only really damage Avengers if it gets stellar reviews
2015-05-01 16:36:28,3,0,3,Tomorrowland,No I saw Fantastic Four AntMan Tomorrowland and Pixels
2015-05-01 16:43:34,1,0,1,Tomorrowland,Nope not even a star wars one Got stuck seeing The Gift Fantastic 4 Tomorrowland and Antman  Pretty underwhelming to say the least
2015-05-01 16:53:24,106,0,106,Tomorrowland,I honestly think Tomorrowland will be a flop
2015-05-01 17:23:58,1,0,1,Tomorrowland,Bergen Norway here Star Wars Tomorrowland and Mad Max All of which looks fucking amazing
2015-05-01 17:53:31,0,0,0,Tomorrowland,IMAX 3d in Canada didnt have the star wars trailer  we got a clip from tomorrowland  though
2015-05-01 18:14:34,2,0,2,Tomorrowland,Same reason I wont be seeing Tomorrowland The trailerteaser felt like it was 510m It was too damn long Felt like I was watching the movie and paid for wrong ticket
2015-05-01 18:23:43,123,0,123,Tomorrowland,I got AntMan Tomorrowland Jurassic World Pixels and Terminator Genisys
2015-05-01 18:37:52,2,0,2,Tomorrowland,I only got to see 2 Disney trailers Antman and Tomorrowland and then the rest were IMO stupid Jump scare and tween movies On one side I was happy there wasnt 30 minutes of trailers on the other I wanted to see star wars on a big screen
2015-05-01 19:06:56,18,0,18,Tomorrowland,Tomorrowland AntMan a new Fantastic Four trailer Batman v Superman in Waterloo ON
2015-05-01 19:18:09,48,0,48,Tomorrowland,Honestly on that entire schedule the only film on that entire list I could see getting kind of fucked is Tomorrowland Clooney will get the domestic draw going but internationally I think Avengers and Inside Out are probably going to hurt it
2015-05-01 19:20:24,68,0,68,Tomorrowland,The trailer for Tomorrowland they played before Avengers AoU was pretty damn smart Instead of ruining the plot for the whole film they showed a really nifty action sequence for the majority of the trailer with Clooney and the MC running from some kind of creepyhappy androids to escape to Tomorrowland Got me interested anyway
2015-05-01 19:26:25,27,0,27,Tomorrowland,Tomorrowland has zero chance of hurting Avengers internationally Families might go to Tomorrowland domestically if its got spectacular word of mouth but I have a feeling any families that would see Tomorrowland based on wordofmouth will probably end up seeing Inside Out since it will be out around the time said wordofmouth wouldve been building to actually mean something
2015-05-01 19:27:06,4,0,4,Tomorrowland,Kitchener here we got Star WarsTomorrowland extended trailerBatman v SupermanJurassic WorldPixels and Inside Out That was noon showing on Fri Stars Wars in IMAX 3D was awesome and Tomorowland looks pretty good
2015-05-01 19:28:50,0,0,0,Tomorrowland,The trailers before the showing I went to were REALLY disappointing MadMax which Ive now seen way too many times Jurassic World Tomorrowland which did look interesting and was a new trailer for me Poultrygeist remake and if there were any others they were even less memorable oh Spy I think they are getting lazier with their titles I was a bit disappointed to not get BvS or Starwars
2015-05-01 19:53:19,0,0,0,Tomorrowland,Jurassic World AntMan Tomorrowland and San Andreas I wouldnt think Marvel would give their rival DC any screen time ahead of their headlining feature
2015-05-01 20:41:25,5,0,5,Tomorrowland,Inside Out comes out a month after Tomorrowland though
2015-05-01 21:04:29,-2,0,-2,Tomorrowland,Tomorrowland Ant man Jurassic Park Pixels everyone bood Adam Sandler amp MI4no star wars and I was disappointed in Avengers too sat next to loud kids and a bunch of other people drinking beer cans in the theaterwasnt pleasant
2015-05-01 21:07:28,1,0,1,Tomorrowland,When we received the trailers SWTFA was only 3D so we had to show tomorrowland and antman
2015-05-01 21:45:22,1,0,1,Tomorrowland,Tomorrowland May 22nd
2015-05-01 21:51:09,22,0,22,Tomorrowland,Love how Disneys actual Tomorrowland park is about as far from a departure to that movie as you can get while staying in the future theme
2015-05-01 22:14:25,1,0,1,Tomorrowland,I got Tomorrowland Fantastic Four Jurassic World Ant Man and Pixels  Dammit Adam Sandler  Ruining good things
2015-05-01 22:21:18,1,0,1,Tomorrowland,God that was my second favorite part of going to the midnight release Tomorrowland just looks so good
2015-05-01 22:57:15,1,0,1,Tomorrowland,Im more excited about Tomorrowland than anything else coming out this summer It might be a flop but I personally think it is going to amaze some people
2015-05-01 23:01:14,1,0,1,Tomorrowland,Saw it in IMAX 3D and got Mad Max Tomorrowland Jurassic World and Terminator Genisys Shame really
2015-05-01 23:03:31,1,0,1,Tomorrowland,I got AntMan Tomorrowland Jurassic World Pixels Fantastic Four Dope and Mission Impossible Rogue Nation
2015-05-01 23:05:59,27,0,27,Tomorrowland,I havent seen anything other than trailers but the city or whatever that is in the Tomorrowland trailer looks very similar to Walts original vision of Epcot A model can be seen while riding the Tomorrowland Transit Authoritys WEDway people mover as you go through Space Mountain
2015-05-01 23:15:15,1,0,1,Tomorrowland,I got Fantastic Four some Zach Galifanikas movie Ant Man Tomorrowland and surprisingly Batman v Superman
2015-05-01 23:28:14,2,0,2,Tomorrowland,Jurassic World should at the very least be decent but all the others listed besides those two movies dont seem like they are going to be very good at all Ive been to the theater 4 times in the past two weeks and Im sick and tired of seeing the Tomorrowland trailers
2015-05-01 23:49:43,2,0,2,Tomorrowland,In Toronto here saw it at IMAX 3D Saw the Tomorrowland trailer but no Star Wars
2015-05-01 23:56:16,1,0,1,Tomorrowland,I got jurassic world tomorrowland antman san andreas pixels and terminator genysis
2015-05-02 00:15:56,1,0,1,Tomorrowland,They had trailers for Tomorrowland Jurassic World Terminator and Star Wars when I went
2015-05-02 02:37:08,1,0,1,Tomorrowland,Thats hearbreaking for Tomorrowland  Im going to see both Avengers and Tomorrowland in theaters this month but honestly Im more excited about Tomorrowland than anything  Jurassic World will be nice to see in theaters too
2015-05-02 04:21:06,27,0,27,Tomorrowland,Supposedly that is why Kathleen Kennedy was against Colin Trevorrow direct Episode VII when George Lucas recommended him Hed only done one small movie and hadnt proven he could handle the big stage If he nails Jurassic World maybe he is a contender to fill in for Trank Though I assume Kennedy will go back to Bird who she also talked to about directing Episode VII Hes a known quantity at Disney and he just finished Tomorrowland
2015-05-02 04:50:41,8,0,8,Tomorrowland,I think Tomorrowland will end up as this years Edge of Tomorrow a movie that end up making a lot of money but people will constantly say it was a flop anyway
2015-05-02 05:13:13,14,0,14,Tomorrowland,Apparently Brad Bird was Kathleen Kennedys 1 pick for Star Wars before they hired JJ Abrams But Brad Bird didnt want to lose the chance to make Tomorrowland so he suggested that he would do Tomorrowland by himself and then codirect Star Wars 7 with Trevorrowhttpwwwslashfilmcomjurassicworldstarwars
2015-05-02 05:56:55,1,0,1,Tomorrowland,My showing had Fantastic Four Star Wars Batman V Superman and Tomorrowland
2015-05-02 07:57:52,1,0,1,Tomorrowland,I got Star Wars AntMan Tomorrowland and Batman v Superman It is rather pathetic how 2 of the strongest members of the DC universe in their trailer was out done by AntMan and Thomas the fucking tank engine
2015-05-02 13:59:31,1,0,1,Tomorrowland,That trailer for tomorrowland though It pretty much ruins the story You might as well show up 45 minutes late because the entire beginning is summarized
2015-05-02 14:32:39,1,0,1,Tomorrowland,At iMax 3D I got Batman vs Superman star wars Jurassic world and tomorrowland Everyone cheered when the Lucasfilms logo popped up
2015-05-02 15:09:49,5,0,5,Tomorrowland,Really I got Tomorrowland
2015-05-02 17:23:43,2,0,2,Tomorrowland,But has Treverrow seen Tomorrowland and given his opinion if this is a thing were doing now
2015-05-02 17:26:37,0,0,0,Tomorrowland,Personally Im hoping all sequels and reboots flop I want new movies not the same shit over and over Another Mad Max More Terminators Another impossible mission No thanks give me something new like Tomorrowland any day
2015-05-02 17:27:38,1,0,1,Tomorrowland,I dont know about flops but I see Mad Max Terminator Tomorrowland and Jurassic World all performing below expectations
2015-05-03 00:22:02,1,0,1,Tomorrowland,Tomorrowland
2015-05-03 06:32:35,1,0,1,Tomorrowland,Tomorrowland was filmed close to me
2015-05-04 16:29:35,1,0,1,Tomorrowland,Really  Tomorrowland doesnt seem like a giant moneymaker to me
2015-05-04 17:23:44,3,0,3,Tomorrowland,Yeah I got Antman Tomorrowland which looks cool and a fucking local ad for a barbershop
2015-05-06 03:46:28,1,0,1,Tomorrowland,I saw it in Imax and only had this like 8 min long Tomorrowland clip
2015-05-07 15:51:19,1,0,1,Tomorrowland,We got Tomorrowland
2015-05-08 12:23:06,2,0,2,Tomorrowland,This and Tomorrowland are the only movies I will see in the theater for sure this summer
2015-05-08 21:11:30,6,0,6,Tomorrowland,gt Edge of Tomorrowland
2015-05-10 03:57:22,-8,0,-8,Tomorrowland,Thats disappointing after he proved himself on Mission Impossible and Tomorrowland seems like a safe bet Id hoped to see him keep doing more original live action stuff
2015-05-10 04:21:06,342,0,342,Tomorrowland,I have a lot of faith in this project Brad Bird only picks scripts that he loves I mean he turned down Star Wars to do Tomorrowland
2015-05-10 04:59:34,2,0,2,Tomorrowland,Jurassic World now more than ever just bought a bunch of JW products yesterday Bridge of Spies The Revenant Inside Out Tomorrowland Ant Man MI5 In the Heart of the Sea The Walk Everest Spectre Ricki and the Flash Southpaw Black Mass Crimson Peak Goosebumps Brooklyn and finally The Force Awakens
2015-05-10 06:04:00,2,0,2,Tomorrowland,Fuck tomorrowland this will be his highest grossing movie
2015-05-10 06:15:42,1,0,1,Tomorrowland,My friend worked on tomorrowland I hope it does good
2015-05-10 06:19:03,180,0,180,Tomorrowland,The Iron Giant the Incredibles Ratatouille Ghost Protocol and Tomorrowland This man can do no wrong I have no doubt that this will be as good if not better than the first which is the best Pixar film Thats like being the best on the US All Stars team
2015-05-10 06:36:54,120,0,120,Tomorrowland,I know I will get chastised for this But the fact that Damon Lindelof wrote the script for Tomorrowland with Brad Bird was all I needed to hear to get excited for that movie And then I heard that Brad Bird who is very adamant about working on projects with strong scripts was confirmed as directorand that only enhanced my excitement for this movie I cant wait All of you that hate on Damon Lindeloff Just know that Brad Bird turned down freakin Star Wars to make Tomorrowland with Damon Lindeloff
2015-05-10 06:52:40,20,0,20,Tomorrowland,Damon Lindelof writes terrible scripts Brad obviously reeled him in That or Tomorrowland sucks Im looking forward to it though
2015-05-10 07:17:51,118,0,118,Tomorrowland,Brad didnt turn down Star Wars to make Tomorrowland He was already in the midst of Tomorrowland when they asked him so he couldnt he did want to Also Brad has cowritten the script with Damon
2015-05-10 07:41:22,33,0,33,Tomorrowland,Im keen to see what Lindelof does with something entirely his own The last few movies he wrote Cowboys and Aliens Star Trek Into Darkness Prometheus have all been part of a franchise or written with the transformers hacks I loved his work on Lost and the Leftovers so Im hoping for the best with Tomorrowland
2015-05-10 07:42:32,8,0,8,Tomorrowland,Tomorrowland looks like shit
2015-05-10 07:46:19,1,0,1,Tomorrowland,Tomorrowland looks amazing
2015-05-10 08:00:35,2,0,2,Tomorrowland,I take it that Tomorrowland is pretty good if theyre willing to give him Incredibles 2
2015-05-10 10:11:43,5,0,5,Tomorrowland,So Pirates of the Caribbean Tron Black Hole Tomorrowland National Treasure Marvel Indiana Jones Star Wars and the Muppets in the same universe How the fuck would that work
2015-05-10 10:22:52,1,0,1,Tomorrowland,He was already working on Tomorrowland when they asked him hence why he had to say no
2015-05-10 10:27:29,2,0,2,Tomorrowland,Ghost Protocol was really fun but if Tomorrowland turns out great Ill never even think twice about seeing a Brad Bird film again not that I do now really but I am waiting for reviews on Tomorrowland before buying tickets
2015-05-10 11:13:48,1,0,1,Tomorrowland,Isnt the movie based on a Disney theme park ride called Tomorrowland Similar to Pirates of the Caribbean I dont know anything about the ride but it has been around since the 50s so Im assuming Lindelof had some preexisting lore or story or something that goes with the theme park ride which he expanded on or used as inspiration for the movie
2015-05-10 13:25:14,5,0,5,Tomorrowland,Why in pluperfect hell doesnt the _Tomorrowland_ trailer mention Brad Bird
2015-05-10 13:50:44,1,0,1,Tomorrowland,My opinion on this will very much depend on the quality of Tomorrowland that being said Brad Bird is one of my absolute favorites
2015-05-10 19:00:27,-4,0,-4,Tomorrowland,Tomorrowland I cant even tell what its about from the trailer It looks just awful
2015-05-10 19:58:34,11,0,11,Tomorrowland,Tomorrowland
2015-05-10 20:02:38,1,0,1,Tomorrowland,Pretty sure his next movies Tomorrowland Been seeing ads for it like crazy
2015-05-10 20:09:12,3,0,3,Tomorrowland,gt and Tomorrowland
2015-05-10 20:12:23,-1,0,-1,Tomorrowland,Trailers can be wrong but the trailers for Tomorrowland instill a sense of wonder that perfectly goes along with the theme of the movie Plus its Brad Bird and George Clooney
2015-05-10 20:39:05,0,0,0,Tomorrowland,But he turned down star wars because he was busy with this already not because he thought tomorrowland had more potential or anything It seems alright but I dont think the material is good enough for the director
2015-05-12 05:51:42,4,0,4,Tomorrowland,and Tomorrowland right
2015-05-12 05:54:16,5,0,5,Tomorrowland,Now Tomorrowland then back to animation for Incredibles 2
2015-05-12 11:38:47,4,0,4,Tomorrowland,Yep The previews didnt sell me on Tomorrowland but because of his involvement  Ill see it opening weekend
2015-05-12 16:28:29,3,0,3,Tomorrowland,Tomorrowland looks interesting Out May 22 Also Pixars Inside Out out June 19
2015-05-14 22:32:02,351,0,351,Tomorrowland,After the inevitable success of Tomorrowland Im willing to bet Warner will let Brad Bird do just about anything he wants
2015-05-15 02:18:12,2,0,2,Tomorrowland,Good to know I might catch it in theaters sometime soon maybe like Sunday or next weekend That is if Im not busy watching Tomorrowlandgeez thats coming out in a week
2015-05-15 03:35:36,113,0,113,Tomorrowland,Tomorrowland looks fucking terrible
2015-05-15 04:03:01,140,0,140,Tomorrowland,I dont doubt that it could be good But the previews just look like some completely unguided bullshit ad hoc world storytelling in a norules universe To me that removes any semblance of tension or actual character investment since literally anything can just happen to solve the problems Main guy gets shot well actually thats no big deal theres this thing we havent told you about until just now where the power of love can heal his wounds IN TOMORROWLAND
2015-05-15 05:19:37,-1,0,-1,Tomorrowland,Tomorrowland looks awesome
2015-05-15 06:17:56,80,0,80,Tomorrowland,I dont think Tomorrowland is going to do very well
2015-05-15 06:37:28,2,0,2,Tomorrowland,Id love the pin from Tomorrowland and apparently thats more possible than I think
2015-05-15 07:10:41,16,0,16,Tomorrowland,I can agree that the trailers for Tomorrowland have been terrible It doesnt have any sense of tension with the fast cut of the jetpackwearer flying over head as its best attempt at it I think its just not meant to be that type of movie Though the other trailer featuring the main character and Clooney together in his house was pretty cool with all of its unique traps But it also showed the film to be pretty different from what I was expecting Less futuristic utopia more steampunk time travelling genius type of deal
2015-05-15 07:35:23,1,0,1,Tomorrowland,I think Tomorrowland looks like a really good book that was turned into a movie that wasnt able to entirely capture the intricacy of the plot I have no clue if Tomorrowland was based off a book or not but it certainly has that vibe If thats a vibe you can pick up from a trailer thats probably bad
2015-05-15 08:35:22,1,0,1,Tomorrowland,Word of mouth is going to be crucial in this one Its got Avengers and Tomorrowland to contend with Im not sure there is enough of an audience to support it just on the Rrated action front it needs to pull in a big chunk of the broad spectacle seekers too Problem is lots of them will be going to see the other two and lots of them arent interested in a weird looking Rrated car movie
2015-05-15 10:09:09,28,0,28,Tomorrowland,gt After the inevitable success of Tomorrowland Im willing to bet Warner will let Brad Bird do just about anything he wants
2015-05-15 14:18:35,1,0,1,Tomorrowland,I dont want to spoil too much but I sense that theres going to be plenty of tension given the Tomorrowland spoilerss guns fighting robot mech suits people cut down by a laser grid needing to launch the Eiffel Tower rocket as an escape system and other turmoil in the real world Also weve yet to see why Casey is in a police station at all when she gets the pin Its going to be good I think
2015-05-15 14:47:08,1,0,1,Tomorrowland,Hope that was sarcasm about tomorrowland
2015-05-15 18:07:28,1,0,1,Tomorrowland,agreed  im actually more pumped for tomorrowland than superman v batman  i just have a bad feeling about s v b  tommorrowland reminds me somewhat of neopolis from alan moores book top 10
2015-05-16 12:32:01,2,0,2,Tomorrowland,I think its going to be a great year in movies Between the already released great movies Kingsman It Follows Ex Machina Mad Max Fury Road and the upcoming ones that look to be good Tomorrowland Jurassic World although this may be more of a personal bias Star Wars The Revenant Bridge of Spies Carol Inside Out Southpaw Ricki and the Flash Crimson Peak Black Mass etc this year just looks amazing
2015-05-16 16:42:07,28,0,28,Tomorrowland,They probably should have pulled a Guardians of the Galaxy and released it at the tail end of the summer Now it will have to deal with PP2 and Tomorrowland next week
2015-05-16 17:06:11,-3,0,-3,Tomorrowland,True but Max definitely will have an advantage later by having legs PP2 definitely does not have the same charm as the first and has MORE than its share of problematic stuff keeping it from being a genuinely good movie which people are talking about like crazy on my feeds Come next week I think Pitch is gonna drop hard which will couple with the Tomorrowland bomb and might open up the top slot
2015-05-16 17:30:11,54,0,54,Tomorrowland,Then it would need to deal with Mission Impossible and Fantastic Four I think Tomorrowland and PP2 is easier competition IMO
2015-05-16 19:31:26,6,0,6,Tomorrowland,I think this one could stay up in the top five for a long time while all the other big movies open big and then fall San Andreas Terminator Jurassic World for example  If it stays number two next week behind Tomorrowland thatll be a good sign
2015-05-16 19:58:03,7,0,7,Tomorrowland,Tomorrowland yesI wonder how Fury Road will fare against San Andreas
2015-05-16 20:41:52,3,0,3,Tomorrowland,Tomorrowland is tracking to make more next weekend than Max did this weekend Still not a good sign for a movie with a huge budget and Clooney It will be 1 though
2015-05-16 21:56:54,7,0,7,Tomorrowland,I saw Mad Max and it was amazing but I dont think word of mouth is gonna save it Next week Tomorrowland and Poltergeist come out and there are so many big movies in theaters that Mad Max wont do that well Plus the week after San Andreas comes out We can hope for 200 million worldwide by then end of its run which is still a very poor performance given how much money was put into the movie
2015-05-16 22:39:25,12,0,12,Tomorrowland,I really think Tomorrowland is going to be something of a sleeper hit this summer
2015-05-16 23:06:33,24,0,24,Tomorrowland,Not really Max will have great legs internationally Im not from the US but no one here Australia gives a damn about Tomorrowland or San Andreas And i havent heard may people from outside the US excited about them either Although Max wont do that well overall id put it 250300 Which is really good for an R Rated Movie But if it stays in the cinema as long as Kingsman has been in there for then maybe 350 isnt out of the question
2015-05-17 00:04:54,1,0,1,Tomorrowland,Tomorrowland isnt even the same demographic
2015-05-17 00:11:19,6,0,6,Tomorrowland,They barely even show trailers here for Tomorrowland Ive seen 2 out of the 10 times Ive been to the cinema and none of them have made us want to see it San Andreas just shows the same boring trailer that makes 2012 look good
2015-05-17 03:03:13,1,0,1,Tomorrowland,Yes but people can have various interest I was able to see Mad Max this weekend but if not Im not sure which id pick between Mad Max and Tomorrowland
2015-05-17 09:28:43,1,0,1,Tomorrowland,He was already quite far into preproduction when they asked him to do Star Wars If he wasnt already committed to making Tomorrowland hed have made Star Wars
2015-05-17 09:41:51,1,0,1,Tomorrowland,I would argue the scarcity is growing smaller however they still have yet to make the women the leads of the story But this year were seeing improvements starwars tomorrowland hunger games inside out juper ascending Arguably jurrasic world and terminator
2015-05-17 11:24:25,2,0,2,Tomorrowland,Tomorrowland is a PG rated science fiction film Mad Max is a R rated action film
2015-05-17 15:21:08,3,0,3,Tomorrowland,Well Brad bird started working on Tomorrowland before Star Wars gig came to him I can see him directing SW9 though
2015-05-17 16:54:23,21,0,21,Tomorrowland,Tomorrowland
2015-05-17 17:46:17,3,0,3,Tomorrowland,Warner Bros is generally pretty conservative as the majors go  Compared to Tomorrowland and Poltergeist Pitch Perfect 2 is the biggest nonR film to open around this period so what might happen next week is that PP2 will see its numbers drop as its a sequel but Mad Max will pick up momentum on the gargantuan word of mouth its got going for it
2015-05-17 22:34:17,2,0,2,Tomorrowland,First review Ive read While tomorrowland wasnt on my theatre list I was definitely hopeful that Bird could keep the streak going
2015-05-17 23:11:59,0,0,0,Tomorrowland,I think Brad Bird is the best period But I feel like hes not making the impact he could be right now He actually turned down Star Wars Ep VII to finish Tomorrowland And even though The Incredibles is one of my top 5 fave movies of all time there are plenty of projects Id rather see him do than an Incredibles sequel
2015-05-17 23:20:03,1,0,1,Tomorrowland,Tomorrowland comes out next week
2015-05-17 23:36:20,1,0,1,Tomorrowland,it was my understanding that Tomorrowland had no where near the hype surrounding it that MMFR or Avengers 2 had Also rated PG
2015-05-18 01:08:32,-3,0,-3,Tomorrowland,If Tomorrowland fails to meet expectations Id actually be glad he turned down Star Wars This was his passion project If he couldnt excel at that how can we expect him to for a property that hes not intimately involved with
2015-05-18 03:51:04,12,0,12,Tomorrowland,Im so frustrated by what Im hearing about this movie I admire Brad Birdbut for the longest time it seemed like I was the only one unsettled by the underlining message in The Incredibles That whole bit about how when everyone is specialno one is Yeahthat always seemed messed up to me Now it turns out that there are MASSIVE RandianObjectivist overtones in TOMORROWLAND and its all kind of starting tosadlymake sense
2015-05-18 04:24:33,1,0,1,Tomorrowland,Its a different circumstance entirely and even if Tomorrowland winds up reviewing poorly theres nothing to say it will flop
2015-05-18 04:31:04,1,0,1,Tomorrowland,Ehh id say see both Fury road is AMAZING so if you see tomorrowland first it might make fury road even better
2015-05-18 05:05:25,5,0,5,Tomorrowland,YeahI should have phrased that better What I meant wasthe way SindromeSyndromeis presented as the villain of The Incredibles is what I dont really agree with The whole bit about how the supers are forced to compromise and hide their superior abilities to conform with society That shit is a VERY objectivist philosophy By making the tagline about how when everyone is superno one is the villains mantraits basically saying that there ARE people who are better than everyone elsethe Supersand they are the ones who should be in control of the world Apparently TOMORROWLAND has an even more heavyhanded objectivist POV
2015-05-18 06:18:20,1,0,1,Tomorrowland,true i was thinking about waiting to just rent tomorrowland but ill see
2015-05-18 13:09:51,2,0,2,Tomorrowland,Terminator Genysis Jurrasic World and Tomorrowland
2015-05-18 14:54:45,9,0,9,Tomorrowland,meanwhile Disneys other summer flick Tomorrowland is sadly opening to soso reviews  currently 74 on Rotten Tomatoes
2015-05-18 16:23:03,1,0,1,Tomorrowland,Those talented directors whose careers Damon Lindelof supposedly ruined were his bosses as were multiple producers and executives He wrote the films they wanted they approved interpreted and executed those screenplays to their liking For example his scripting work on Prometheus was pretty much entirely comprised of Ridley Scott telling him what he wanted and Lindelof actually putting it on paper Hell considering that his work on Star Trek was rewriting a script by noted hacks Orzi and Kurtzmann who knows how much he actually improved Into Darkness Maybe the lesson people should be taking away from Tomorrowland is that Brad Bird on his own divorced from the meticulously planned world of animation doesnt have a very good instinct for structuring his films
2015-05-18 17:09:55,0,0,0,Tomorrowland,Which is unfortunate since youd figure with constant rabbling about remakes reboots sequels and prequels dominating the big studio lineup people would be more willing to give original untested projects a chance Tomorrowland being based off a theme park section and John Carter off of a book notwithstanding But Ive just seen a lot of snark in the tweets reacting to it Of course original doesnt mean a guaranteed good story or a free pass to be flawed but
2015-05-18 18:21:24,0,0,0,Tomorrowland,Well Tomorrowland looks like an old rehashed ideakid goes to a fantasy world and has to become their savior
2015-05-18 18:22:16,2,0,2,Tomorrowland,Are there bad reviews for Tomorrowland It has a 76 on Rotten Tomatoes and Ive only seen like two bad reviews
2015-05-18 18:33:20,-1,0,-1,Tomorrowland,You mean Tomorrowland
2015-05-18 19:54:58,1,0,1,Tomorrowland,These are the only movies Ive seen this year I also watched furious 7 but after I watch Tomorrowland and fury road I dont expect it to be on the list
2015-05-19 00:00:45,1,0,1,Tomorrowland,I said a while back on here when the first trailers and posters were being released that while I didnt want to see Tomorrowland fail I had a feeling that it might not do as well as expected the situation had a John CarterTron Legacy feel about it
2015-05-19 00:08:33,-7,0,-7,Tomorrowland,Tomorrowland will be the big budget must see movie this coming weekend Poltergeist will be the genre movie to see this weekendthose will take away a lot of potential viewers whod give Mad Max a shot based on word of mouth I tried to hype up as many people as possible to see Mad Max who would normally not see such a movie only a few went and they hated it This movie has no cross over strength
2015-05-19 02:49:17,1,0,1,Tomorrowland,gtEdge of Tomorrowland
2015-05-19 07:59:07,10,0,10,Tomorrowland,I work at a DVD store I literally get to see every movie that was released last year come through that door and I can definitely tell you what youre saying is demonstrably not true in terms of whats coming out now Half of the movies released are dramas drom coms or horror films The amount of childish action is not really in huge supply Seriously 4 superhero films came out last year not including TMNT People have always wanted to see big budget blockbusters in theaters But what was the highest grossing film last year It wasnt one of the three super hero movies it was American Sniper A drama It made more money and had more interest than any of the big 15 year old loving films of the decade That was just last year And it was accompanied by a million dramas like Cake Selma Still Alice Fury a freakin war film Into the Woods a musical Imitation Game various R rated comedies adult comedies dont come out Neighbors 22 Jump Street This is where I leave you were not for kids and many more art think pieces Birdman Theory of Everything So I just cant see how your argument is valid Sure we are getting more superhero films but that doesnt mean were getting less variety If anything hollywood is taking even more chances on films with original ideas or risky ideas and variety than ever Tomorrowland Mad Max Inside Out Pitch Perfect to name some other tentpoles this summer This concocted notion that Comic book movies dominate film is just not true The few that come out a year make excellent cash and are increasingly pushing both the boundaries of their genre and of film in general SOOOOO many films come out of hollywood besides superhero flicks so I just dont get why youre upset about that Whats wrong with getting the same excitement out of a film that appeals to 15 year old you Isnt that what movies are supposed to do Make you get that awe and inspiration that you did when you were a kid
2015-05-20 15:22:44,26,0,26,Tomorrowland,Oh fuck off David This unwillingness to accept any modicum of criticism is such bullshit If people dont like your movie its not everyones fault Its your fault for making a shitty movie What a douchebag If I dont like Tomorrowland it isnt because Im cynical its because I didnt like Tomorrowland
2015-05-20 16:35:16,4,0,4,Tomorrowland,In an interview recently he said he gave up Episode VII for Tomorrowland to promote original content Kind of a protest against franchising the crap out of something
2015-05-20 17:40:02,5,0,5,Tomorrowland,I couldnt discern any real plot from the trailers other than girl goes to tomorrowland and sees tomorrow stuff
2015-05-20 18:09:00,1,0,1,Tomorrowland,Fanboys of the tomorrowland section of Disneylandworld duh Havent you been to the tomorrowcon Geez guys
2015-05-20 18:14:30,3,0,3,Tomorrowland,Really Ive loved every Brad Bird movie so far and thought Tomorrowland looks pretty promising I would be pretty surprised if it was a let down from his previous work
2015-05-20 18:52:12,1,0,1,Tomorrowland,I have seen the movie I love Brad Bird love George Clooney love Tomorrowland at Disneyland and I really really wanted to like it
2015-05-20 18:54:02,3,0,3,Tomorrowland,It was more Tomorrowland was his baby and he knew Episode VII would get made with or without him He was already working on Tomorrowland for a while before he was offered the Episode VII gig
2015-05-20 19:08:03,0,0,0,Tomorrowland,i know its probably splitting hairs here but tomorrowland is and its a stretch based off of a preexisting existing property yeah its a disneyworld attraction but still not wholly original
2015-05-20 19:22:05,1,0,1,Tomorrowland,Spoiler Once the machine told them there was no future that is when they rejected Clooney and stopped immigration they then destroyed the pins Tomorrowland stopped progressing and turned into the ruins we see in the later part of the movie Hugh Laurie then called the people on Earth savages he was the recruiter but stopped after the tachyon machine He was a recruiter but stopped EDIT Hugh Laurie rejects Clooney but Althea recruits him She thought he was good enough Hugh Laurie not so much He spends four years in Tommorrowland From age 11 to 15 when he is rejected after creating the Tachyon machine There are 3 versions of Tommorowland The 60s version we see young Clooney in There is the idealized version we see through the pin A recruitment film of sorts And the broken version of Tommorrowland we see at the end of the film
2015-05-20 20:55:11,0,0,0,Tomorrowland,Fanboys of Tomorrowland Is that a thing And are they complaining about the movie
2015-05-20 21:53:49,1,0,1,Tomorrowland,He would look awesome in Tomorrowland that new movie coming up because thats more his caliber these low budget projects arent him  is what I meant

2015-05-21 14:26:33,3,0,3,Tomorrowland,I see that youve been downvoted a lot but Tomorrowland became a skip movie for me the second I saw Damon Lindelofs name attached to it
2015-05-21 20:48:35,1,0,1,Tomorrowland,Tomorrowland and terminator
2015-05-22 02:25:45,1,0,1,Tomorrowland,Tss tss Tomorrowland Wut about todayland
2015-05-22 02:31:42,7,0,7,Tomorrowland,What this film really lacked was a good villain We never really knew he it was until like the last 20 minutes or so and Hugh Laurie got an awesome monologue but he wasnt set up nearly enough That plus a general lack of Tomorrowland apart from the beginning and end makes this film nothing special for me Still a fun ride though just expected more from Brad Bird
2015-05-22 02:34:23,3,0,3,Tomorrowland,New No No If youre going to release a movie called Tomorrowland release it tomorrow not tonight
2015-05-22 02:48:48,81,0,81,Tomorrowland,TOMORROWLAND
2015-05-22 03:04:26,6,0,6,Tomorrowland,Going to be a tough sell because its 80 exposition but when that falls away and you see the visuals and the world of Tomorrowland its pretty sweet Definitely could be considered Interstellar for kids in many ways
2015-05-22 03:10:20,12,0,12,Tomorrowland,Movie blue balls  That is what Tomorrowland gave me  I was expecting something major and then dud
2015-05-22 03:52:27,59,0,59,Tomorrowland,Sort of briefly much of the spirit of the movie as advertised optimism resourcefulness invention creativity shows up mostly as backstory nostalgia for a fallen or endangered place Tomorrowland where things were better and could be again with the help of a chosen protagonist  but this doesnt pay off in the final act The main heroines arc is completed not by using the dying old world values of science and engineering that the first act shows she keeps alive in an increasingly ambivalent present in any meaningful way but rather in a single moment of connect the plot dots that in no way requires her individual experiences or skills This is in spite of her being built up as one who presumably through her pure vision and uncynical grit has been said on multiple occasions to be capable of fixing it Her trivial revelation also shows the main antagonists actions to be not a plan so much as an unfortunate accident
2015-05-22 04:04:54,74,0,74,Tomorrowland,EXT TOMORROWLAND FINALLY  DAY
2015-05-22 04:37:08,35,0,35,Tomorrowland,The entire Eiffel tower sequence could be completely removed It meant NOTHING Just have the satellites shoot them into Tomorrowland instead of dicking around with a wax Tesla statue
2015-05-22 05:56:39,20,0,20,Tomorrowland,Honestly Tomorrowland being mediocre made me sigh in relief that Bird didnt do Star Wars 7
2015-05-22 06:08:38,1,0,1,Tomorrowland,Uhhh Lindelof wrote Tomorrowland before Bird was attached sweet peach
2015-05-22 06:10:39,5,0,5,Tomorrowland,Umm I did watch Tomorrowland and every other movie in Birds filmography too
2015-05-22 06:17:51,101,0,101,Tomorrowland,Let me preface this by saying that The Iron Giant is my favorite film of all time and Brad Bird is my favorite director Tomorrowland was a misfire on nearly every level
2015-05-22 07:30:14,1,0,1,Tomorrowland,Tomorrowland is a festival in Belgium Its project T now
2015-05-22 07:42:17,0,0,0,Tomorrowland,Miles From Tomorrowland Season 1 Episode 8
2015-05-22 12:30:05,1,0,1,Tomorrowland,Folks I get that youve already ignited the torches and pitchforks for Lindelof However Tomorrowland was also written by Brad Bird
2015-05-22 14:02:00,26,0,26,Tomorrowland,I suspect the Eiffel tower sequence was a way to include the Disneyland Paris Discoveryland theme which is opposite to Tomorrowlands theme Ie a glimpse of how people of the past envisioned the future instead of Tomorrowlands more contemporary vision

2015-05-22 16:47:32,2,0,2,Tomorrowland,I wont be that harshly on Bird for this  I mean making a movie out of Tomorrowland Disney parks is not easy  I never sense there was a story to a piece of a Disney park in the first place

2015-05-22 19:07:31,2,0,2,Tomorrowland,He never actually wanted that it was a joke from an interview  Apparently he wanted to poke fun at the universebuilding that Disney has been up to lately by crossing all the biggest universes together with Sam Jackson as Fury holding a lightsaber at the end of Tomorrowland saying Wait Im in THIS too  Its a joke
2015-05-22 21:57:35,2,0,2,Tomorrowland,the cue for tomorrowland was interesting and distinctly disney world in a nice recognizable giacchino way but nothing else stood out would have to listen further
2015-05-22 22:06:48,13,0,13,Tomorrowland,I love Brad Bird love George Clooney love Tomorrowland at Disneyland and I really really wanted to like it
2015-05-23 02:37:59,1,0,1,Tomorrowland,I havent seen Tomorrowland yet but based on the trailer Im having a lot of trouble seeing how this could be anything like Flight of the Navigator
2015-05-23 04:02:24,1,0,1,Tomorrowland,I thought we were gonna get to see more of tomorrowlandbut nope  I still liked it though
2015-05-23 04:33:04,2,0,2,Tomorrowland,If he did Star Wars VII Tomorrowland would have been completely scrapped Wed probably never see it
2015-05-23 05:56:54,0,0,0,Tomorrowland,My wife and several people I know worked on this film  And I totally agree with you on some of the strange execution of the film  Originally the idea dealt much more with Plus Ultra and Tomorrowland Walt Disney himself Tesla etc  There was a much more adult sci fi feel that the world was built on and how Tomorrowland worked why it was better etc  That was all Lindelof then they rewrote it halfway through and Brads childlike hope and dreaming started to creep in and took over  There were also some reshoots at the end that took Judy Greer entirely out of the movie and moved some major things around the main girl had a mom for example  So I think some of the things youre not happy with got lost along the way
2015-05-23 06:06:06,1,0,1,Tomorrowland,The opening bits when we saw Tomorrowland was pretty neat but the montage where the teachers were talking about the end really felt heavyhanded The movie picked up in the middle and all of that was a blast but the third act was a bit fuzzy Not so much that it was bad just under developed
2015-05-23 10:55:57,1,0,1,Tomorrowland,Tomorrowland Dont Act Hope
2015-05-23 14:40:33,1,0,1,Tomorrowland,You know unless theres a novelization or a commentary track we may never know but heres my take on that I agree that Nix didnt think he was evil that he thought he was trying to save the world But the reason he reacted to Casey and Frank the way he did was fear Look at it from his perspective the Monitor still says that theres a 99994 chance that Earth is doomed If Earth finds out that Tomorrowland exists before then but too late to turn things around then all thats going to happen is that the same rich and powerful people who wrecked the Earth are going to dedicate all of their attention towards building their own escape portals to Tomorrowland towards conquering it too so they can escape and leave the rest of us behind And Nix is probably thinking he cant risk that because if that happens then nobody survives At least his way the people already on Tomorrowland survive and they can keep telling themselves that they tried to save the rest of us From his perspective its too late to do anything else
2015-05-23 15:24:17,1,0,1,Tomorrowland,Sadly Tomorrowland felt an awful lot like watching one of the Star Wars prequels Lifeless synthetic and without any tangible danger or sense of awe Plastic Given Birds talent Im crazy disappointed this was one of my most anticipated movies this year Onto see Max again
2015-05-23 16:39:49,1,0,1,Tomorrowland,Tomorrowland since it just came into theaters
2015-05-23 18:26:57,1,0,1,Tomorrowland,I loved LOST and Prometheus and The Leftovers and Tomorrowland
2015-05-23 18:49:53,4,0,4,Tomorrowland,Are you kidding  Thats like the direct opposite of the message of this movie   The dreamers came together to save the future and then they sent out the robot ambassadors to get more dreamers to build a better future for Tomorrowland  Sure Frank Walker George Clooney was introduced as a stubborn stick in the mud but he was neither dumb nor hopeless only discouraged
2015-05-23 20:13:48,1,0,1,Tomorrowland,overall its a 410  the film is not smooth at all and thats apparent in the very rough opening i thought the audience wasnt that into it but they applauded at the end the end credits was probably my favorite part because of the nice little animation sequence there really is hardly a tomorrowland in the movie its only shown in the beginning and in the end as a desolate run down world i liked some of it but overall it was messy too much cars and highway scenes
2015-05-23 22:05:32,1,0,1,Tomorrowland,I am glad you got that message out of it but honestly I think the message missed the mark  The whole time I thought it wax saying some pretty good things dont be apathetic etc  but then that ending Essentially they just said well this world is fucked time to move on to another world I felt like the whole message became null at that point  There is no Tomorrowland to fall back on  I feel like this movie could give people the impression that this earth is fucked and just to wait it out and start over  For a film that seemed to have some strong messages it just never completely delivered
2015-05-23 23:59:48,2,0,2,Tomorrowland,Can anyone tell me why Frank Walker was banished from Tomorrowland in the first place This is like the biggest plot point and I just didnt see it
2015-05-24 00:57:38,3,0,3,Tomorrowland,Some of use old farts remember Disneylands Tomorrowland attraction Flight to the MoonMission to Mars from the late 1960s and 1970s  There was a sense of wonder and hope for the future but then it was a different time with Apollo missions  I was so dearly hoping Mr Tom Morrow and the Mission Control Room would make at least a cameo

2015-05-24 01:39:01,5,0,5,Tomorrowland,gt Tomorrowland is those scenes stretched to two hours
2015-05-24 01:49:43,2,0,2,Tomorrowland,I enjoyed the movie The specials effects were great and the standout performance was the little girl who played the recruiter Clooney was also pretty entertaining He isnt the smooth swave guy he plays in other movies Im thinking the movie may have been better if they had just focused on clooneys character I did not see the point of Britt Robertsons character They could have done a jumanji type scenario with clooney Like have the recruiter girl lose all memory and need clooney to get her back to tomorrowland after getting kicked out
2015-05-24 01:56:42,1,0,1,Tomorrowland,yeah they should have shown us more of the better tomorrowland to inspire people
2015-05-24 03:19:02,12,0,12,Tomorrowland,I saw it in front of Tomorrowland
2015-05-24 03:37:23,8,0,8,Tomorrowland,This afternoon with TomorrowLand I clapped No one else did It was awkward
2015-05-24 03:57:45,1,0,1,Tomorrowland,We dont usually do December trailers in early summer because there are way more movies coming first Should be on Tomorrowland most places
2015-05-24 04:48:45,1,0,1,Tomorrowland,I have seen it in a normal theater for Avengers Mall Cop Tomorrowland and Chappie Actually getting annoyed at the trailer because I know I will be seeing it until December for every movie it seems
2015-05-24 04:55:02,1,0,1,Tomorrowland,When she touches the pin in the open field and she gets the tour of Tomorrowland
2015-05-24 05:05:31,14,0,14,Tomorrowland,Ok one thing Im missing and hoping someone can answer Did they ever specifically say what caused tomorrowland to basically become vacant and run down
2015-05-24 05:49:58,1,0,1,Tomorrowland,I guess the trailer was really deceiving You expect that Clooney amp Co would reach Tomorrowland in the first 30 mins of the movie but instead the first two acts are drawn out Even the more actionpacked scenes felt too long
2015-05-24 05:50:44,2,0,2,Tomorrowland,Nothing went wrong The movie was good The score was great I loved the long take through Tomorrowland Good humor Predictable ending People are pissy because it wasnt mindblowing What theyre forgetting is that this was a movie for 12 year olds Build a bridge and get over the fact that it wasnt Interstellar meets Looper with the color palate of a Pacific Rim To me I felt the Disney magic It felt like a Disney ride actually All this being said Honest Trailers is gonna have a field day 12 year old me says A present day me says solid B on the verge of B Future me has no regrets seeing it and is actually happy he did which is what really matters
2015-05-24 06:32:59,1,0,1,Tomorrowland,Yes in front of Age of Ultron and Tomorrowland both at Cinebarre
2015-05-24 07:00:28,1,0,1,Tomorrowland,saw it in standard def in front of tomorrowland It was really crazy because there were ton of kids and i heard a few dads go hey look at this pal
2015-05-24 07:14:53,2,0,2,Tomorrowland,Nix said that if they let everyone Tomorrowland would suffer the same fate because people are barbaric and what not
2015-05-24 08:17:15,2,0,2,Tomorrowland,The only point i might disagree with is 4 I got the feeling that the original tomorrowland setup was a scientist only world where in the new batch of recruits there were musicians and artists andwhatever else hipsters do A scientist or two for good measure but mostly new age hippie stuff
2015-05-24 08:20:25,8,0,8,Tomorrowland,yeah all that was extremely goofy but that whole long take of casey exploring tomorrowland was really amazing probably my favorite part of the movie
2015-05-24 08:56:16,10,0,10,Tomorrowland,Its Brad Bird of Pixar fame and Tomorrowland is basically a live action Pixar movie with their trademark innocence and optimism
2015-05-24 09:32:56,2,0,2,Tomorrowland,Honestly saying I didnt understand the movie that much I mean that what was tomorrowland like what was that place about and why did Athena want to show everyone that place
2015-05-24 10:43:46,1,0,1,Tomorrowland,The trailer and tv ads were very deceiving  The kid in the rocket pack looks to be a major part of the film and is about 3 minutes of screentime  Theres maybe 20 min of tomorrowland itself in a 2 hour film This film is one of the worst bait and switches that hollywood has pulled in awhile
2015-05-24 11:35:53,1,0,1,Tomorrowland,Lindelof is the biggest hack in Hollywood right now Prometheus Lost and now people are surprised Tomorrowland sucks too
2015-05-24 15:02:39,36,0,36,Tomorrowland,Tomorrowland
2015-05-24 16:08:37,437,0,437,Tomorrowland,Yes it has happened before Its honestly not a big deal at all Being 1 just means they can add it to TV spots but even if Tomorrowland beats out Pitch Perfect 2 then PP will just run TV spots saying 1 comedy in the country
2015-05-24 16:35:44,1,0,1,Tomorrowland,they also didnt really explain who house was was he robot or human he didnt age at all  He mentioned drinking his shake every morning did tomorrowland cure aging
2015-05-24 16:40:26,1,0,1,Tomorrowland,Saw it yesterday for Tomorrowland in standard at AMC
2015-05-24 17:14:03,2,0,2,Tomorrowland,Tomorrowland was pretty dark Spoilers Ahead There was a timer counting the days until the world ending Clooneys character was incredibly cynical Tomorrowland was completely barren and abandoned when they actually got there Yeah the girl was optimistic and the ending was happy but thats pretty standard Enjoyed it quite a bit though because it had more of a message than a lot of blockbusters
2015-05-24 17:18:23,4,0,4,Tomorrowland,Tomorrowland the movie was a mess  Pretty and some good acting at times but writing and plot was a complete mess
2015-05-24 17:41:11,10,0,10,Tomorrowland,Yeah you always notice that And if Tomorrowland loses youll see them say Americas number one drama or something
2015-05-24 18:02:41,1,0,1,Tomorrowland,Hopefully he does better with this than he did with Tomorrowland which was much like the movie very uneven I think he was trying for an homage to The Rocketeer during the jetpack scene but it ended up coming across as a parody of it
2015-05-24 18:06:00,32,0,32,Tomorrowland,Regardless of what it ends up with it will be considered a success considering the trouble they had getting it made  You dont see a lot of studios spending 150 million on R rated action movies and I dont think Warner Bros intended to either  So even if its not profitable its not a huge loss like Tomorrowland is looking up to be  And eventually theyll make their money back on the home market   Im sure Warner Bros is very happy with the numbers theyre getting
2015-05-24 18:09:40,34,0,34,Tomorrowland,I saw Tomorrowland last night and I still dont know what its about
2015-05-24 18:10:07,17,0,17,Tomorrowland,A lot of people say the trailers give away too much Go read the comments under the post for Tomorrowlandhttpwwwredditcomrmoviescomments373qc9box_office_tomorrowland_tops_slow_memorial_day and see that the top comment is about having no idea what the movie is about from the trailer And its true the Tomorrowland trailer gives you very very little to go on And I like that Now apparently the movie itself wasnt very good but more importantly not a lot of people saw it it won the weekend but made much less than Disney had hoped People dont like to be tricked and people dont like spending money on things that they dont know what theyre spending their money on
2015-05-24 18:18:28,55,0,55,Tomorrowland,I watched Tomorrowland last night and Ill warn those of you who havent seen it to stay away and save your money  The movie cant find any type of direction and is a complete wreck Im not sure if it was poor editing or just a terrible script
2015-05-24 18:21:56,42,0,42,Tomorrowland,I dont know if its because I hadnt seen any of the trailers or what but I really enjoyed Tomorrowland
2015-05-24 18:46:53,15,0,15,Tomorrowland,For anyone interested Tomorrowland had 75 the budget John Carter had
2015-05-24 18:50:37,0,0,0,Tomorrowland,Not Tomorrowland
2015-05-24 18:54:13,28,0,28,Tomorrowland,If Tomorrowland is supposed to be a vision of tomorrow then count me out It was a sterile looking place all white with nothing interesting to show us Yeah jetpacks Woohoo The story is bland and really doesnt send a great message If any message at all
2015-05-24 18:54:21,17,0,17,Tomorrowland,Currently a 49 on rotten tomatoeshttpwwwrottentomatoescommtomorrowland_2015 John Carter is a 51
2015-05-24 18:59:00,12,0,12,Tomorrowland,The movie is called Mission Impossible Ghost Protocol which Brad Bird also directed  I think its a combination of bad writing and poor marketing  I havent seen even one ad for Tomorrowland on TV
2015-05-24 19:03:42,44,0,44,Tomorrowland,One scene had a girl saying well only being going 20 light years out mother there was a fully sentient robot girl an anti aging breakfast shake guns that liquefied people multiverse radio transmission seeing into the future and past via tachyon particles among other stuff Id say jetpacks were some day one shit in Tomorrowland
2015-05-24 19:20:21,28,0,28,Tomorrowland,This might be specially sad for Brad Bird since he turned down Star Wars Episode VII to direct Tomorrowland insteadhttpwwwcinemablendcommnewBradBirdSaidStarWarsEpisodeVIIHereWhy67696html
2015-05-24 19:33:03,3,0,3,Tomorrowland,Damn  Tomorrowland juputer ascending and jurassic world This guy is on fire
2015-05-24 19:39:18,-1,0,-1,Tomorrowland,Well at least theres Mad Max to go watch Honestly presummer is always a dumping ground for shit movies Tomorrowland is no different from those
2015-05-24 19:40:16,9,0,9,Tomorrowland,I dunno I saw the trailer  for Tomorrowland and Im guessing its about a girl who gets whisked away to a special magical land where she the chosen one or whatever to save stuff for some reason
2015-05-24 19:42:24,2,0,2,Tomorrowland,I just wish theyd shown more of the actual tomorrowland I get why they did but if they had just explored Franks childhood a little more
2015-05-24 19:43:28,8,0,8,Tomorrowland,My friends and I discussed this at length after the movie We believe that with no more new blood dreamers the ideas and innovation at Tomorrowland stagnated Everyone became too complacent and things stopped evolving and started decaying
2015-05-24 19:47:13,4,0,4,Tomorrowland,I agree I liked the first 23 but once they get to Tomorrowland it takes a real turn for the worse
2015-05-24 19:49:35,4,0,4,Tomorrowland,Its not like he was building a whole new universe with Tomorrowland anyways Everyone is going to associate Tomorrowland with the place in the theme park
2015-05-24 20:25:15,90,0,90,Tomorrowland,Wow I was actually impressed with the trailers as I was under the impression they were leaving most of the actual Tomorrowland out of it to build anticipation  Wasnt expecting that to be because there really isnt much of it at all to show
2015-05-24 20:36:32,2,0,2,Tomorrowland,From what Ive been hearing the trailers for Tomorrowland set expectations that were not delivered upon This says a lot about the legitimate harm marketing can do for a film when those in charge dont understand what the film for which theyre marketing is actually trying to deliver
2015-05-24 20:42:00,13,0,13,Tomorrowland,Not to mention just how lastminute that whole end of the world conflict was The movie went from I have to get to Tomorrowland in the first hour and forty minutes to the world will be destroyed by climate change in two months and we have to stop it in the last fifteen minutes
2015-05-24 21:02:39,0,0,0,Tomorrowland,The movie is horrible it has no thread its a complete mess The acting is ok Clooney is always fantastic but the whole thing is a horrible mess Too little Tomorrowland and too much  whatever that shit was
2015-05-24 21:58:20,7,0,7,Tomorrowland,gt However once they get to Tomorrowland it finally comes to fruition that it has been deserted Its now a desolate grey wasteland think crumbling buildings no people etc
2015-05-24 22:12:06,1,0,1,Tomorrowland,Technically it was Tomorrowland but only because I didnt see anything else this week I wasnt a fan
2015-05-24 22:35:34,-1,0,-1,Tomorrowland,It is if the studio decides it is The fact that Mad Max lost to Pitch Perfect 2 and Tomorrowland means that we wont get our sequels because itll be too big of a risk
2015-05-24 22:49:50,3,0,3,Tomorrowland,I hear people rave about the trailers but the trailers did nothing to get me excited What got me excited was the Tomorrowland IMAX Preview that came up before Age Of Ultron which made it look super fucking fun
2015-05-24 23:05:34,3,0,3,Tomorrowland,Man Tomorrowland really wasnt that bad
2015-05-24 23:26:21,1,0,1,Tomorrowland,In the last week Ive seen The Strange Colour of Your Bodys Tears Solaris 1972 Tomorrowland and A Girl Walks Home Alone at Night
2015-05-25 00:20:03,1,0,1,Tomorrowland,I saw Tomorrowland I felt satisfied and excited during the whole movie Its definitely not anything like Mad Max but its still a movie thats worth checking out
2015-05-25 01:17:06,2,0,2,Tomorrowland,gt Thing is it isnt really optimistic in the end When they arrive at Tomorrowland it turned into a wasteland just like in every other postapocalypticdystopia movie They never even really explain why that happened
2015-05-25 01:28:34,2,0,2,Tomorrowland,I thought the movie was pretty enjoyable and definitely worth checking out if you have already seen Mad Max or Ex Machina The villain was pretty weak and there were some moments that made me want to role my eyes like the fatherdaughter relationship but Tomorrowland was a very original plot something we dont see in hollywood very often and all the performances were great Raffey Cassidy is a very talented child star that I think we will see a lot in the future I fucking loved all the references to Star Wars Iron Giant and The Incredibles in the collectible store 710
2015-05-25 01:53:27,1,0,1,Tomorrowland,On paper having Tomorrowland be a sham isnt a bad idea Like the Wizard of Oz you get to the wizard and hes not a real wizard spoilers that sort of thing But what Im imagining is clearly not what went down based on peoples reactions
2015-05-25 01:54:56,-2,0,-2,Tomorrowland,Below 50 because literally every movie that my friend hyped up for us has ended up receiving a rotten score or fresh score but been disappointing Jupiter Ascending Dracula Untold Transformers 4 Tomorrowland Hobbit BotFA Exodus Gods and Kings Godzilla and Amazing SpiderMan 2
2015-05-25 02:10:18,24,0,24,Tomorrowland,Minority report here I just got back from it and I thought it was fantastic It deals with some pretty big ideas that I dont see anyone giving it credit for The Tomorrowland in the commercials represents how we used to view the future there will be jetpacks and flying cars robots and lasers That optimistic view is what took us to the moon Now every depiction of the future is postapocalyptic and pessimistic Were shutting down NASA and letting the world go to shit We cant have Tomorrowland because we dont believe in a good future anymore Its a selffulfilling prophecy The movie is very onthenose about its message but I think its packaged in a cool way
2015-05-25 02:33:25,2,0,2,Tomorrowland,Thats too bad I actually liked Tomorrowland except the ending Its really different from the pretty mysterious trailers so I bet a lot of people who were interested in the trailer will be put off after reading or seeing reviews saying that
2015-05-25 02:47:09,1,0,1,Tomorrowland,I saw Tomorrowland tonight and LOVED IT
2015-05-25 03:26:50,2,0,2,Tomorrowland,My big problem is that I was expecting a totally different movie from what I got  I had seen all of the trailers and I was vaguely aware that Disney had done some kind of online game that involved Walt Disney being a member of this Plus Ultra group that had created Tomorrowland  So here is what I was expecting
2015-05-25 03:28:23,1,0,1,Tomorrowland,Tomorrowland doesnt work  Now Brad Birds pedigree is beyond reproach and Disney certainly put plenty of resources into this project  Unfortunately the magic is missing
2015-05-25 03:51:31,10,0,10,Tomorrowland,Tomorrowland
2015-05-25 04:01:09,-2,0,-2,Tomorrowland,How has this movie not gotten sued yet for copyright infringement Tomorrowland is the name of an EDM music festival in Atlanta founded by the same group that puts together TomorrowWorld Maybe Im missing something but Tomorrowland has been in existence for at least 3 years they hyped it almost a whole year before the first festival
2015-05-25 04:34:59,3,0,3,Tomorrowland,Thank god someone else is asking these questions as I wondered if I was the only one and hadnt put pieces together Near as I could tell Frank was banished for the creation of a doomsday clockbut wait Nix invented the machine that transmitted the disaster stories from earthbut Nix said he SENT them there to warn people what Why did postTomorrowland look like modern day Detroit what destroyed it Frank tells Casey the pin showed her an advertisement but he was escorted out before Tomorroland was foreclosed uponhow does HE know about the downfall So MANY plot problems continuity problems dont throw your actors in lakes if you dont want them soaked throughout a movie and all in service to a Disneylandworld advert
2015-05-25 04:42:17,6,0,6,Tomorrowland,Because Tomorrowland is also the name of one of the original lands at Disneyland A theme park that opened in 1955 60 years ago
2015-05-25 04:45:44,1,0,1,Tomorrowland,I loathed this movie and wanted to walk at the point Clooney is talking to the camera at the beginning because 4th wall breakage bugs me Then you see Tomorrowland and think heh this is CGI Incredibles this could BE somethingand  then you see it ONE MORE TIME IN THE WHOLE MOVIE That is just ONE of many problems I dont know why the lack of plot coherence doesnt bug anyone else but it sure did me How long has Athena been recruiting for as aged as Clooney is What happened to destroy Tomorrowland Why do about 20 people come out at the end was there a plague Didnt it appear there were hundreds of thousands when Frank was a boy Why should Nix hold on to power in his Utopia when it looks like an abandoned mall on the outskirts of Chernobyl He should be THRILLED Frank has some ideas at that point His machine transmits messages from earth Or implants them as he states Franks clock got him banished If so it is Nixs machine that caused Frank to create the clock why the shade from Nix it is a natural progression Just because Casey says positive things why would that change things Is this land ruled by the author of The Secret And where can i buy Clooneys khaki pants that instadri after being drenched in a lake
2015-05-25 06:05:02,1,0,1,Tomorrowland,I saw this movie last night and found it mildly entertaining  One nagging question I had though that no one else seems to comment on is exactly what and where Tomorrowland actually is
2015-05-25 12:08:49,1,0,1,Tomorrowland,Ugh I was just waiting for the line of You took the best the world had to offer and were surprised when it crumbled And then they use the device to stop tomorrowland from forming in the first place thus all those people are never taken from the world and then the final shot can be the world changing from being doomed to looking just like tomorrowland looked in the first place
2015-05-25 12:23:03,1,0,1,Tomorrowland,Thank you No idea what movie these people saw but Tomorrowland was great These folks have zero imagination and seem like they go into theaters in a bad mood demanding filmmakers make a perfect movie or they will just tear it apart T
2015-05-25 12:40:32,1,0,1,Tomorrowland,Oh you mean Disney Tomorrowland A World Beyond
2015-05-25 13:52:34,1,0,1,Tomorrowland,Yeah Deadlinehttpdeadlinecom201505tomorrowlandpoltergeistmemorialdayboxofficeweekend1201431715s Sunday AM update had it at 407m for FridayMonday and 32159m for FridaySunday
2015-05-25 14:06:35,1,0,1,Tomorrowland,What I didnt understand was WHY was Tomorrowland abandoned Like they had a dimension portal TO Earth but Earth was doomedDid they just go to different planets or something It sounded like Tomorrowland was a perfectly fine place to be
2015-05-25 14:10:42,1,0,1,Tomorrowland,True but it had clear direction of what the story was going to be about  There is no Tomorrowland ride like there was with Pirates  Tomorrowland is more of a theme encompassing a bunch of different rides at the park
2015-05-25 14:53:33,1,0,1,Tomorrowland,Out of curiosity what in Tomorrowland did you wantneed explained in the third act
2015-05-25 15:36:53,0,0,0,Tomorrowland,Nope You missed the message and apparently took the plot too literally In fact that message you propose is exactly the opposite of the films message Tomorrowland failed because thats what they originally did which is why at the end you see the new recruiters introducing Tomorrowland to all types of people not just geniuses
2015-05-25 16:47:52,1,0,1,Tomorrowland,I wish the movie spent more time in Tomorrowland than in a car getting there
2015-05-25 16:52:47,2,0,2,Tomorrowland,Nix believed that there were no more ubermensch to find and world should die while our heroes believe they can still be found and enticed to abandon the world for Galts Gulch sorry Tomorrowland I have a hard time sympathizing
2015-05-25 18:02:29,2,0,2,Tomorrowland,The Tomorrowland that everyone saw with the pin was a fake Tomorrowland meant to get people excited The only people that ever truly went to Tomorrowland is a small group of investors and inventors Thats why Tomorrowland seems so empty They were planning on giving Tomorrowland to the world in 20 years but obviously that never happened
2015-05-25 19:30:04,1,0,1,Tomorrowland,It does have a few weeks of no major competition but then Jurassic World is out And when Jurassic World is released its game over for Tomorrowland Which means the movie has just under three weeks to pick up steam
2015-05-25 19:54:43,17,0,17,Tomorrowland,Well I agree that it sucks when an original film doesnt do well However Tomorrowland was a very big disappointment I just want to see good films regardless of whether theyre based on something
2015-05-25 20:18:04,1,0,1,Tomorrowland,I thought maybe that was the case as well but then I realized that in the scene at the very beginning of the movie the scene where George Clooney is addressing the Tomorrowland recruiters that would end up being at the very end of the film the countdown to the end of the Earth is still running
2015-05-25 20:25:04,4,0,4,Tomorrowland,I think that relatively poor marketing played a big role in Tomorrowland underperforming  Disney has one of the most impressive marketing machines in the world  If it wanted to the company could have bombarded us with TV commercials online ads billboards the whole works  Instead the only time I saw any Tomorrowland marketing was a trailer in the theater
2015-05-25 20:28:17,0,0,0,Tomorrowland,Tomorrowland
2015-05-25 20:31:12,24,0,24,Tomorrowland,That 50httpwwwrottentomatoescommtomorrowland_2015 on rottentomatoes certainly didnt help I know Im not speaking for the average Joe Consumer here but the lackluster reviews really turned me off from checking it out
2015-05-25 20:43:02,7,0,7,Tomorrowland,Little early to be calling it a bomb Its not like its Tomorrowland
2015-05-25 22:27:10,1,0,1,Tomorrowland,Remakes and sequels are easy money because there is already a fanbase that will want to go see the movie Original movies are hard to market but its not impossible for them to succeed at the box office Hell take a look at It Follows Sure it didnt make the big bucks but it made back more than double its budget John Wick Interstellar Hell just look at the Indie sphere if you want some original flicks Personally I would have seen Tomorrowland if
2015-05-25 22:58:16,1,0,1,Tomorrowland,Okay I saw it a second time last night  Now that I knew what to expect the film did make more sense  However it is way too rushed  Maybe it should have been two movies  The first movie could be all about the founders and building Tomorrowland and it could have ended with the Frank being banished and the second one could have been about finding Casey and saving Tomorrowland  The one thing I noticed the second time is that it has some pretty dumb parts in it  In particular Frank crashing into the ground over and over again as a kid would be dead Frank falling off of the platform in time and then manuevering himself in the air over to his also falling rocket pack bullshit Casey falling down the stairs would be dead and Frank again hitting the water while fallingflying with his rocketpack probably would be dead  I guess that stuff is to make it funnier for kids
2015-05-25 22:59:31,3,0,3,Tomorrowland,The problems with Tomorrowland are the same problems that most of Lindelofs projects have it has cool ideas but ends up more interested in themes than a story that makes sense Giant plot points that kick off the whole story left me with major questions secondguessing whether any of it makes sense
2015-05-25 23:26:21,-2,0,-2,Tomorrowland,Its really the fault of viewers for paying to see the Marvel and Michael Bay stuff instead of anything original and reviewers who give good reviews to empty movies like those and average reviews to something like Tomorrowland in comparison because I dont know why
2015-05-25 23:30:04,2,0,2,Tomorrowland,For some strange reason its actually because the copyright for Tomorrowland is owned by Disney in America however they dont have the copyright most everywhere else Which is odd but thus the Disney Tomorrowland A World Beyond Although I totally agree about the missing a s Hope that clears up part of it
2015-05-26 00:06:19,2,0,2,Tomorrowland,Does anyone feel like Tomorrowland was what Walt originally wanted EPCOT to be
2015-05-26 00:42:08,1,0,1,Tomorrowland,I want original and good Tomorrowland is only the first in a minor way and not the second It is entertaining at best But could be 15 hours not 2 to really have the entertainment value
2015-05-26 00:52:39,4,0,4,Tomorrowland,Recently Tomorrowland
2015-05-26 01:32:54,0,0,0,Tomorrowland,I saw Pitch Perfect 2 and I really really liked that but its sitting at 67 so Im not sure that counts Im planning on watching Tomorrowland here soon
2015-05-26 01:57:21,18,0,18,Tomorrowland,No thats Tomorrowland
2015-05-26 03:09:57,1,0,1,Tomorrowland,I dont think it looks good at all But Im sure it will make lots of box office money My theater was roaring with laughter yesterday when a trailer for it played before Tomorrowland
2015-05-26 04:41:20,2,0,2,Tomorrowland,I thought the film started out with promise and raised alot of questions And then thats all it did I was expecting the film to be the journey WITHIN Tomorrowland or to spend more time in it but it was mostly about them getting to Tomorrowland and when they did it was all a let down I felt just as fooled as the main character The ending is what really takes one whole star away for me It creates a lot of questions about why casey is special and how she is going to fix things She seems to have some mystical direct effect on everything and knows how they work but the solution couldve been figured out by anyone
2015-05-26 05:46:17,1,0,1,Tomorrowland,Apparently you havent seen Tomorrowland
2015-05-26 05:57:25,1,0,1,Tomorrowland,tomorrowland spoilers she isnt really a kid though
2015-05-26 07:33:05,2,0,2,Tomorrowland,for Tomorrowland the disney logo switches the usual castle for the futuristic Tomorrowland skyline
2015-05-26 10:00:05,1,0,1,Tomorrowland,Tomorrowland is a young adult movie without an IP to back it up IP and restrained production values is what makes young adult movies such money makers This one just doesnt have the appeal or word of mouth to propel it to a higher box office
2015-05-26 11:19:39,29,0,29,Tomorrowland,Or that nothing great opened this weekend Tomorrowland was okay Pitch Perfect 2 and Mad Max were out the weekend before Avengers has been out for 3 weeks now If Tomorrowland was better Im sure it wouldve been better ticket wise
2015-05-26 11:55:25,4,0,4,Tomorrowland,John Carter was a perfectly good movie that was too bland to be produced on the scale and context that it was with the expectations that come along with that without some kind of effectively clever marketing push See Tomorrowland Lone Ranger
2015-05-26 12:35:50,2,0,2,Tomorrowland,At the end the new reciters were sent out to bring more dreamers to Tomorrowland right Because it seems like the regular world is what needed the dreamers to make a better place not to strip the intellectual and creative elite from this world
2015-05-26 12:57:44,2,0,2,Tomorrowland,Late to the party but I was so hyped for this movie and was completely floored at how mediocre it was Tomorrowland had such potential Even the first act with child Frank despite the corniness was so neat Theres a great big beautiful tomorrow I was set for something fun
2015-05-26 13:19:33,1,0,1,Tomorrowland,Correct me if I am wrong but in the end of the movie were they not recruiting people to live in Tomorrowland
2015-05-26 13:34:44,2,0,2,Tomorrowland,I think the trailers have been the biggest problem Ive seen about 3 different trailers for TomorrowLand and still have no idea what its about
2015-05-26 13:48:43,5,0,5,Tomorrowland,gtIf Tomorrowland was better Im sure it wouldve been better ticket wise
2015-05-26 15:02:30,6,0,6,Tomorrowland,Turns out Sea of Trees is a pile of shit And apparently Tomorrowland was disappointing from what ive heard I have high hopes for Jurrasic World but I think it would either be great or just generic
2015-05-26 15:08:00,2,0,2,Tomorrowland,Tomorrowland
2015-05-26 15:32:02,1,0,1,Tomorrowland,Normally Id agree but it has a lot of competition Upon release it will still have to contend with Fury Road Tomorrowland Pitch Perfect 2 and Age of Ultron
2015-05-26 16:13:52,1,0,1,Tomorrowland,I think the biggest problem is that the entire movie happens not in Tomorrowland She spends the whole movie trying to get to Tomorrowland se we can all figure out why Last 30 minutes we spend some time in a ghost town of tomorrowland Plot solved in 15 minutes and they killed the villain Really was not necessary He was not even a bad guy Just killed him
2015-05-26 16:16:27,1,0,1,Tomorrowland,movie is a 65 at best For a movie called tomorrowland and the trailers built this big mystery around tomorrowland They spent almost the entire movie in normal land trying to get to tomorrowland
2015-05-26 16:41:53,9,0,9,Tomorrowland,I know its somewhat offtopic but I feel in 1520 years Tomorrowland will start coming up as an answer Its not bad but not good either but kids will love it
2015-05-26 16:54:50,2,0,2,Tomorrowland,YES I was immediately struck by the Randian themes of the movie One has to wonder what happens to all the plumbers and housebuilders that arent so exceptional in the world of Tomorrowland I guess theyre the slave labor that get to build all the shiny towers
2015-05-26 16:57:23,3,0,3,Tomorrowland,It seems like a lot of people missed the point or maybe ads led people to believe it was a different movie than it was I dont knowI avoided trailerscommercials The common reaction Im seeing is theyre disappointed the third act or more of the film in general didnt take place in a bustling lively Tomorrowland But it makes complete sense that it is desolate if all the dreamers are gone The film is saying want a brighter future Dont settle for a bleak worldview
2015-05-26 19:16:45,3,0,3,Tomorrowland,Im in a similar boat to your friend Ive had some terrible things happen in my life and thats lead me down some dark and cynical roads but by the time the credits rolled I too believed that there should be a great big beautiful tomorrow Ive always thought that CBT was a big load of shit but after watching tomorrowland and some introspection Im starting to see the light
2015-05-26 19:18:53,1,0,1,Tomorrowland,Tomorrowland was actually pretty decent for a kids film Problem was that it wasnt marketed that way
2015-05-26 19:24:18,2,0,2,Tomorrowland,I keep waiting for somebody to mention this but didnt anybody else think it was crazy weird that Frank would have invented a grenade sized thermonuclear bomb Or that the robots would self destruct so violently And of all the things he grabs on his way BACK to Tomorrowland he grabs the bomb
2015-05-26 19:42:50,3,0,3,Tomorrowland,My opinion it was implied When they the Tomorrowlanders built that prediction machine with young Franks help it showed them that the world would end at a certain future date with 100 certainty ie it was inevitable and they could do nothing to change it Thats pretty devastating news even for these optimistic geniuses So I guess many gave up hope of making a difference and went their separate ways Also explains why Frank became so cynical And whats the use of recruiting new people if there was no future to change Only Athena didnt give up and continued recruiting
2015-05-26 21:08:32,1,0,1,Tomorrowland,To be fair Tomorrowland is a new IP and a rather entertaining film  but its doing poorly at the box office
2015-05-26 22:38:00,-1,0,-1,Tomorrowland,Except for Ex Machina And Grand Budapest Hotel And It Follows And Interstellar And Her And Tomorrowland And The Babadook And Edge of Tomorrow And Snowpiercer And Crimson Peak And The Machine And Fury And Whiplash
2015-05-26 23:21:45,2,0,2,Tomorrowland,Nothing really came out apart from a Poltergeist remake the nobody wanted and a Tomorrowland that flopped  It was a bad weekend considering previous and future releases this year
2015-05-26 23:37:02,-5,0,-5,Tomorrowland,I have a feeling hell regret Tomorrowland too
2015-05-27 01:21:52,1,0,1,Tomorrowland,I saw that ending comings as soon as they got to tomorrowland Funny how the movie doesnt live by its message
2015-05-27 02:11:19,2,0,2,Tomorrowland,1  Yes it was a timer that he got from the monitor ball thingy that he hijacked the signal from tomorrowland so it was the countdown to the end
2015-05-27 02:49:59,2,0,2,Tomorrowland,Well I am a big Disney fan and I found there to be WAY TOO MUCH exposition in this movie and that was before I read any critical reviews of it  I liked the idea but I think they could have written a much better script that does less explaining every little thing that is happening and just do it  I think that in a movie like this a family fantasy all the explanation is not needed  Other than that I thought it could have used a little more Tomorrowland indeed  I kept thinking to myself that the movie must almost be over when will they get there
2015-05-27 03:21:07,1,0,1,Tomorrowland,That definitely tells a lot of us to skip Tomorrowland
2015-05-27 04:01:18,0,0,0,Tomorrowland,Trust your gut The typical Lindelof trappings are here in full force Tomorrowland is right at home alongside the other three films you mentioned  Started out promising and quickly turned into lazy rushed exposition and a horrible final act
2015-05-27 04:10:33,1,0,1,Tomorrowland,Believe it or not more of them liked Tomorrowland more My friends really scare me sometimes
2015-05-27 04:37:00,1,0,1,Tomorrowland,Yeah well theres a difference between deciding on purely ratings basis like Mad Max which has a 89 on Metacritic and 98 on RottenTomatoes or go see Tomorrowland which has a 60 and 50 respectively You would go see Mad Max right I didnt say the movie was bad I said I wouldnt go see it For example you would probably go out and look at reviews for food restaurants if you wanted to go to a nice place to eat You wouldnt go to the 255 star restaurant right You would go to the 55 star one
2015-05-27 06:09:13,47,0,47,Tomorrowland,Hey I LOVED Tomorrowland
2015-05-27 07:16:20,9,0,9,Tomorrowland,Tomorrowlands design was pretty good but BioShocks design is incredible Just google image search bioshock or bioshock rapture rapture is the underwater city in the video game Bioshock
2015-05-27 07:21:45,-5,0,-5,Tomorrowland,httpbirthmoviesdeathcom20150522howfuryroaddebunkstomorrowland
2015-05-27 07:42:03,2,0,2,Tomorrowland,And when they finally make an original it barely makes a cut Edge of Tomorrow Tomorrowland Jack Reacher Ahem
2015-05-27 07:49:19,52,0,52,Tomorrowland,Basically a city that was built and made to be a utopia with wonderous nearly magical advances in technology that made the city great but ends up becoming a dystopia through the flaws of either the people the science or both Because the city falls into selfdestruction and ruin many of the great scientific advances that made the city great become the horrors and monsters you face in the game If you like dystopian stories you might end up liking Tomorrowland Its not nearly as dark as the Bioshock series however
2015-05-27 08:05:59,3,0,3,Tomorrowland,To go along with others have said heres a trailer Obviously its much more intense and horrifying than Tomorrowland but the underlying premise is similar httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvLmw78t8NgIE
2015-05-27 08:06:43,15,0,15,Tomorrowland,Honestly Tomorrowland was so overly convoluted with the tech and science I get that its a disney movie that its Tomorrowland and that its all a movie That being said it still wasnt that great of a movie The visuals were good it was well acted but the plot was so convenient and while they asked HUGE questions it was all answeredwrapped up with bad things are only bad because you let them be
2015-05-27 08:16:03,198,0,198,Tomorrowland,The movie he wishes Tomorrowland was has already been made  It is called Meet The Robinsons
2015-05-27 08:25:31,1,0,1,Tomorrowland,Now I want to see Tomorrowland in Dolby Vision Or in any cinema that will actually play it in its native 2201 aspect ratio rather than the 2391 they played it in at my local theater
2015-05-27 08:32:08,6,0,6,Tomorrowland,I just saw Tomorrowland it was pretty bleh to be honest  It was a giant ball of cheese
2015-05-27 08:38:56,1,0,1,Tomorrowland,I loved Tomorrowland Just go in and keep in mind that its a kids movie and youll be ok
2015-05-27 08:58:57,77,0,77,Tomorrowland,Meet the Robinsons was definitely a better tomorrowland than tomorrowland
2015-05-27 09:08:45,6,0,6,Tomorrowland,Completely different point Mufasa dying was a HUGE deal The loss of a single life was so dramatic and important to the film and it was a supremely sad feeling surrounding it Compare that to the store scene in Tomorrowland the Android that came to investigate murdered 3 cops willy nilly and I bet you didnt think twice about how passively murder was showed in a PG movie
2015-05-27 10:22:11,3,0,3,Tomorrowland,I have so much mix feelings about tomorrowland I originally skipped seeing it because of so many awful reviews But I might just see it now just to find out if it sucks or not
2015-05-27 10:29:27,7,0,7,Tomorrowland,I just wanted more Tomorrowland in Tomorrowland  Maybe have the city running along just fine when the Monitor gets turned on and starts jacking things up in our world
2015-05-27 10:35:17,12,0,12,Tomorrowland,I absolutely loved Tomorrowland I know its faults but I really got into the characters especially Athena It took balls for Brad Bird to go forward with Frank and her but they made it work in such a believable way I know the 3rd act deterred a lot of people but I really did like the overall message of the film Im really hoping for a sequel
2015-05-27 10:37:43,8,0,8,Tomorrowland,More people died in Tomorrowland than in the first Rambo film
2015-05-27 10:42:50,13,0,13,Tomorrowland,I just watched the Tomorrowland trailer He activates some security shutters They close one by one for dramatic effect I fucking hate that kind of thing It made no fucking sense to close them one by one  that only delays becoming secure
2015-05-27 10:49:38,-1,0,-1,Tomorrowland,Who were the robots in Tomorrowland And why were they after girl
2015-05-27 10:51:59,1,0,1,Tomorrowland,Tomorrowland was a bag of shit
2015-05-27 10:53:07,0,0,0,Tomorrowland,I thought Tomorrowland was a great concept and a welcomed breath of fresh air with really cool visuals I thought the first third or so of the film was incredibly hackneyed and most of the acting by the young ones was pitiful
2015-05-27 11:02:01,-1,0,-1,Tomorrowland,Isnt TomorrowLand based on an amusement park ride
2015-05-27 11:03:00,-2,0,-2,Tomorrowland,Didnt like Tomorrowland Probably because its too much kidsoriented
2015-05-27 11:06:03,1,0,1,Tomorrowland,wasnt there an episode of the simpsons with the same premise as tomorrowland where smart people take control of the city and everything goes to shit fast
2015-05-27 11:10:11,4,0,4,Tomorrowland,gt In tomorrowland it wasnt in the future it was just more advanced city A future telling device became a self fulfilling prophecy machine as it beamed post apocalyptic vision of the future into humanity which only drew humans close to the apocalypse So they had to break the machine It was dumb as fuck
2015-05-27 11:11:54,-3,0,-3,Tomorrowland,huhthats weird Your description of tomorrowland is exactly how I would describe Pitch Perfect 2
2015-05-27 11:22:00,1,0,1,Tomorrowland,Except the movie barely spends any time in Tomorrowland and thinks cramming obnoxious uncomfortable dialogue down our throats for an hour and a half is a better idea
2015-05-27 11:22:39,1,0,1,Tomorrowland,Ahh now I recall Meet the Robinsons Makes sense to also figure out the villain first as well Havent seen Tomorrowland but I dont plan on it
2015-05-27 11:28:17,1,0,1,Tomorrowland,Tomorrowland wasnt that good
2015-05-27 13:26:39,2,0,2,Tomorrowland,Apologies  I assumed due to the article being mainly about the 4K experience with Tomorrowland which was mastered in 4K you were saying that the 4K presentation experience on Avengers AoU was the same So Im not really sure what youre trying to say tbh But really the blame lies with cinemas here  they advertise 4K but around 80 of releases are 2K I imagine the same problems will crop up when 4K BluRay is debuted
2015-05-27 13:48:07,2,0,2,Tomorrowland,Its rated R so less people can see it and up against movies that are seemingly appealing to a broader base Pitch Perfect 2 and Tomorrowland There are major demographic groups that are skipping out on Mad Max who would be in for either of the other two options Tomorrowland while you may have not heard about it it sucks by the way was strongly promoted and also appeals to a broad base as a family movie directed by who is usually one of the great family filmmakers Brad Bird Its also had a massive promotional campaign from Disney Mad Max is still doing pretty well though if I had it my way itd be making a hundred million every week
2015-05-27 13:51:35,0,0,0,Tomorrowland,This message brought to you by Disneys Tomorrowland starring George Clooney
2015-05-27 14:28:21,2,0,2,Tomorrowland,As much hate Tomorrowland gets I love the movie and its soundtrack More specifically the end credits track it just feels so happy and uplifting
2015-05-27 16:25:15,1,0,1,Tomorrowland,Tomorrowland exposes the originality problem Not the last decade of terrible remakes I just watched an Occupy Wallstreet version of Point Break but Tomorrowland really blew the lid off of the originality problem
2015-05-27 20:37:33,1,0,1,Tomorrowland,Depends we have top of the line that run 25 for special suite showings Warren Theaters down to a 7 double showing at the local drivein This week is Tomorrowland and Avengers
2015-05-27 20:56:27,3,0,3,Tomorrowland,A thought I had  Frank says the ad was recorded in Tomorrowland Given the presence of rocketships capable of travelling at least 20 light years away does this mean there are offworld Tomorrowland colonies in this or another dimension in the film universe of course
2015-05-28 00:48:59,3,0,3,Tomorrowland,The issue with Tomorrowland has nothing to do with optimism or its general message
2015-05-28 01:09:34,5,0,5,Tomorrowland,Tomorrowland
2015-05-28 01:40:38,1,0,1,Tomorrowland,The movie was ok But I was disappointed mainly because I went in expecting the majority of the movie to take place IN TOMORROWLAND Not some teenage girl attempting to get there
2015-05-28 05:42:40,1,0,1,Tomorrowland,If you really wanted to see it that bad you would have went to see it the first week  Seriously though there are people that their sole jobs are to predict what movies will make the most money  This past weekend Tomorrowland made more than Mad Max
2015-05-28 08:25:37,2,0,2,Tomorrowland,He actually turned down Episode VII to make Tomorrowland
2015-05-28 12:48:52,1,0,1,Tomorrowland,Disagree I really liked the first 23 but once they got to Tomorrowland they kind of forgot to answer all the questions they bring up before they go Why are there no people in Tomorrowland now Why didnt they let everyone in when they were planning on it Why do they still not let everyone in after George Clooney wins Do people move to Tomorrowland permanently or do they go back and forth Also Hugh Lauries character is just evil for the sake of being evil His motivations dont make sense
2015-05-28 19:50:37,-1,0,-1,Tomorrowland,I was really impressed with Raffey Cassidy in Tomorrowland That may be pushing the childacting part a bit though
2015-05-28 22:26:36,3,0,3,Tomorrowland,You should be pleased to hear that the composer behind Tomorrowland Michael Giacchino also scores the upcoming Jurassic World Hes said he wants to combine fresh and new themes along with the old ones from Jurassic Park
2015-05-29 05:30:42,1,0,1,Tomorrowland,Case in hand I really really wanted to watch Tomorrowland and Brad Bird is one of my favorite directors When it released last week suddenly the bad reviews started popping up Now despite being one of the most anticipated movies of the year I guess I dont want to spend money in the theater I have made up my mind to watch it in DVD On the other hand I cant wait to go watch Mad Max again
2015-05-29 07:57:42,1,0,1,Tomorrowland,My thought is that they were all kicked out just like Clooney was In the movie they do mention how they tomorrowlanders locked all the entrance points and effectively locked everyone out This is why they have to use the Eiffel Tower rocket to get to Tommorowland By the use of a secret private access point Either that or they all got up and left after seeing the unavoidable demise of earth
2015-05-29 10:31:07,1,0,1,Tomorrowland,What Tomorrowland seems to completely miss is that dystopian storytelling isnt about predicting a future as much as it is about addressing problems of today Showing a future that exaggerates current problems helps us to fix them here and now And its downright idiotic to act like theres anything actually wrong with writing a story that contains conflict People dont write about negative futures because theyd like to see them actually happen
2015-05-29 10:34:15,-1,0,-1,Tomorrowland,What a bad movie The story never even got to Tomorrowland When the filmmakers themselves dont even seem to have a clear idea of the world theyre creating You cant really expect the audience to
2015-05-29 11:34:25,1,0,1,Tomorrowland,Sorry for not using paragraphs I meant to but forgot tbh I think you should definitely see it for the aspects that are worth it Also Tomorrowland appears in the beginning too It also appears as small scenes during the whole movie until the end In the end you dont see much exterior its mostly just interior in Tomorrowland Felt you should know that
2015-05-29 12:40:01,3,0,3,Tomorrowland,Is he Hes for example not ranked on the list of directors at TSPDT and Ive probably never seen him mentioned as a director on any other more serious list He doesnt seem to be that widely mentioned and that highly regarded in film literature in general either I wouldnt rank him so high after seeing his three animated feature films hes mostly a mediocre Hollywood director in my eyes And I doubt that Mission Impossible  Ghost Protocol 2011 and Tomorrowland A World Beyond 2015 would change my view of him I think hes mostly highly regarded by every Tom Dick and Harry the general IMDb users people on Reddit the mainstream critics over at RT and judges who give out the more commercial awards just to take some examples
2015-05-29 13:20:00,3242,0,3242,Tomorrowland,I love how everyone is using Tomorrowland bombing as the big hook to get people in to see original films Shit has to be good for me to want to go see it
2015-05-29 13:30:55,435,0,435,Tomorrowland,Maybe Tomorrowland will find its audience when they remake it in 6 years
2015-05-29 13:42:55,1008,0,1008,Tomorrowland,Isnt Tomorrowland the latest in a line of Disney movies based on Disney theme park rides Is that considered a model of originality now
2015-05-29 13:54:09,82,0,82,Tomorrowland,I think a major issue with Tomorrowland is that the trailers did a piss poor job of showing what the movie about
2015-05-29 14:01:53,-6,0,-6,Tomorrowland,Id like to point out that the author uses Tomorrowland as an example of a bigger issue The bigger issue is about the fallacy that audiences want original ideas from Hollywood The issue is not rather or not Tomorrowland is good or not
2015-05-29 14:06:16,6,0,6,Tomorrowland,Theyre using Tomorrowland as an example of an original idea from Hollywood Its a Disney movie based on a ride from one of their theme parks If it does well we can expect to see Tomorrowland 2 Tomorrowland 3 etc
2015-05-29 14:07:52,45,0,45,Tomorrowland,I want to know whats original in Tomorrowland It seems to me to be just another action adventure flick
2015-05-29 14:08:34,8,0,8,Tomorrowland,I disagree Theyre using Tomorrowland to point to the bigger issue but they dont address that bigger issue The author spends the article talking about Tomorrowland
2015-05-29 14:17:02,645,0,645,Tomorrowland,There was very little originality on display in Tomorrowland Mad Max Fury Road although technically part of a longrunning franchise felt a million times more fresh and original than Disneys glorified Clooneystarring theme park commercial
2015-05-29 14:20:45,13,0,13,Tomorrowland,While you are right that they are all every bit as original as Tomorrowland part of the point is that Tomorrowland itself isnt that original
2015-05-29 14:23:09,5,0,5,Tomorrowland,And the original film needs to be good Cant blame anyone who didnt pay to see Jupiter Ascending or Tomorrowland
2015-05-29 14:23:23,6,0,6,Tomorrowland,Original is in awwwwwwfully big quote marks for that list  Almost as big as for Tomorrowland
2015-05-29 14:30:07,220,0,220,Tomorrowland,While Im not advocating for Tomorrowland specifically I can see the argument from both sides As a critic I may rank certain movies better than others but that doesnt mean that I think only good movies should exist  I love movies whether I criticize or praise them  Rarely do I ever see a movie that I find totally unwatchable even if its awful though one or two have almost made me walk out
2015-05-29 14:43:52,1,0,1,Tomorrowland,I understand Mad Max Fury Road is technically a part of a franchise but I think its separate enough to class as an original These are the films we need to be supporting Tomorrowland is an example but I think its cushioned with enough Disney buzz and marketing
2015-05-29 14:47:50,2,0,2,Tomorrowland,Tomorrowland had tremendous potential but was really underwhelming  Most movies today feel that way as well  Its getting to the point where I tell myself The longer I wait the less money Ill have to pay to watch something Ill forget about in a few days
2015-05-29 14:48:25,1,0,1,Tomorrowland,The article says that Tomorrowland will make profit so whats the issue Why does every cool original film need to make record profits for studios to continue making them The problem isnt that people arent supporting the films the problem is that studios set expectations and its considered a flop if it doesnt surpass expectations
2015-05-29 14:48:46,133,0,133,Tomorrowland,Brought to you by the marketing department at Disney  Go see Tomorrowland today
2015-05-29 14:50:02,5,0,5,Tomorrowland,1Yes Pirates of the caribean Haunted Mansion tomorrowland
2015-05-29 14:51:57,27,0,27,Tomorrowland,This is a crybaby piece by some guy who didnt even like Tomorrowland
2015-05-29 14:52:16,1,0,1,Tomorrowland,In the last years time we got movies like Edge of Tomorrow John Wick Interstellar Ex machina Mad Max Sin City Guardians of Galaxy and im sure much more that I didnt just name that were well done opinions aside and for the most part original films Tomorrowland is not even close to what I would call an original film or a great film Yes the movie wasnt bad but good enough to preach it needs support not a chance The movie borders on false advertising as it does not deliver the Tomorrowland we saw in the trailers without spoiling too much the trailer was only about a 10ish minute scene of the movie
2015-05-29 14:52:28,2,0,2,Tomorrowland,We arent getting original films  The last two movies I watched were Interstellar and the Imitation Game Its not like the original film industry is dead so going and seeing movies that look god awful like Tomorrowland isnt going to change the film industry
2015-05-29 14:53:17,18,0,18,Tomorrowland,And Tomorrowland is based off of a theme park in the same vein as Pirates of the Caribbean if thats your point
2015-05-29 14:55:00,42,0,42,Tomorrowland,Exactly if Tomorrowland was a box office smash hit Disney wouldnt say to themselves Lets make more original movies theyd say Lets start work on Tomorrowland 2 and 3
2015-05-29 14:55:15,1,0,1,Tomorrowland,gtI was sad to see a lot of film critics and movie geeks out there tear Tomorrowland movie down It gave us something very different from what were used to seeing get made with a good message but a good amount of people out there looked past that aspect of it and focused on the faults
2015-05-29 14:58:08,53,0,53,Tomorrowland,So because you dont support the preachy whining Tomorrowland you must not want original films Yeahgot it
2015-05-29 14:58:21,92,0,92,Tomorrowland,I actually watched Tomorrowland cause a friend wanted to see it It was a lot of fun Trailer was misleading though
2015-05-29 14:59:17,29,0,29,Tomorrowland,You you do realize tomorrowland is simply a location in Disney theme parks which houses multiple rides in the zone tomorrowland and not an actual ride right And how is this not an original blockbuster The story setting unless you have a grand imagination while at the magic kingdom everything but the name were original
2015-05-29 14:59:27,1,0,1,Tomorrowland,I really wanted to like TomorrowlandI really didbut I just wasnt good I absolutely loved its positive message but feel like in true Lindelof style it had high concept and heart but the delivery was just terrible I really wish it would have been a movie that would have been more accessible to the PG demographic it was aimed at because I think it certainly packs a valuable message of hope that I havent seen in many movies recently I think missing that mark was its biggest fault for me
2015-05-29 15:00:49,2,0,2,Tomorrowland,Are people not seeing tomorrowland because theres something wrong with society Or are they maybe not seeing because its just not that great Rotten tomatoes gives it a 49 with an audience score of 59 Thats not great for a film that cost 150 million to make
2015-05-29 15:02:48,1,0,1,Tomorrowland,Im pretty sure the  author was paid to talk about risky Tomorrowland he doesnt give a shit about bigger issues
2015-05-29 15:05:21,126,0,126,Tomorrowland,My 2 major issues with Tomorrowland
2015-05-29 15:05:42,164,0,164,Tomorrowland,I didnt see tomorrowland because I was seeing mad max a second time
2015-05-29 15:05:50,75,0,75,Tomorrowland,I liked Tomorrowland
2015-05-29 15:08:41,1,0,1,Tomorrowland,Apparently Im one of the few that liked Tomorrowland
2015-05-29 15:09:03,13,0,13,Tomorrowland,As a novel or movie with a full story behind it Like I said the concept of Tomorrowland isnt new As a media property it is
2015-05-29 15:09:28,456,0,456,Tomorrowland,I love how everyone is using Tomorrowland as an example of an original film when its an adaptation of a Disney attraction If we should be supporting original movies like Tomorrowland where was the outrage when Battleship bombed
2015-05-29 15:10:19,126,0,126,Tomorrowland,Cut out the beginning cut out the whole Eiffel Tower sequence and add 20 minutes of them in Tomorrowland using their imagination to come up with interesting ways to stay alive and one step ahead of House before suddenly coming up with the solution and I think it goes from a 5 to an 8
2015-05-29 15:10:41,1,0,1,Tomorrowland,it always feels like kind of a stretch to label Tomorrowland as a wholly original film
2015-05-29 15:17:19,56,0,56,Tomorrowland,That is what I was thinking I liked the teasers of Tomorrowland then saw a long trailor and really lost any desire to go see it
2015-05-29 15:19:15,35,0,35,Tomorrowland,Putting these 2 bits in spoilers just in cases Where the hell is everybody in Tomorrowland Its the Earth thats screwed not this other dimension but the city is dark and hardly anyone around
2015-05-29 15:20:14,1,0,1,Tomorrowland,Can someone tell me what exactly was wrong with Tomorrowland I didnt think it was terrible and I didnt find any of the acting except Keagens which actually did feel out of place to be so atrocious that it would ruin the whole movie for me and I thought the idea of it was interesting enough What if the worlds smartest people could build completely uninhibited I think thats a cool concept
2015-05-29 15:20:15,0,0,0,Tomorrowland,just got back from seeing Tomorrowland and it was a massive pile of crap
2015-05-29 15:20:18,1,0,1,Tomorrowland,ITT people who did not see Tomorrowland
2015-05-29 15:20:18,1,0,1,Tomorrowland,I keep saying the same thing  And what constitutes original  Its the exact same setup they engineered for Pirates of the Caribbean take a theme park attractive and write a story in to it  If were going to play fast and loose with original then perhaps we should take about movies like Dredd which was critically successful unlike Tomorrowland and had nothing to do with the 90s movie much more comicoriented
2015-05-29 15:22:43,0,0,0,Tomorrowland,Make good original films and people will support them Not the crap that is currently coming out See Tomorrowland as example
2015-05-29 15:23:17,2,0,2,Tomorrowland,gt 1 Not enough time spent in the real Tomorrowland Thats what I was hoping to see more of
2015-05-29 15:23:30,1,0,1,Tomorrowland,Im all for supporting original films but no one wants to be preached to instead of entertained Tomorrowland had a great premise but they didnt use itinstead they made the classic mistake so much exposition and so little character action
2015-05-29 15:25:47,29,0,29,Tomorrowland,I would argue that enough time was spent in Tomorrowland to make you want to be there To make it a place that everyone wants to visit Doing so is supposed to make us want to clean up our world to be more like Tomorrowland An ideal place
2015-05-29 15:26:57,30,0,30,Tomorrowland,Calling it now itll be called Tomorrowland Small World
2015-05-29 15:27:15,1,0,1,Tomorrowland,I didnt see Tomorrowland because the marketing gave me little reason to give a shit and simply being original isnt a valid reason to see a movie by itself
2015-05-29 15:28:19,96,0,96,Tomorrowland,It wasnt actually inspired by Tomorrowland in the Disney parks It was inspired by Walt Disneys obsession with the future and technology which is actually the basis for the land in the parks as well
2015-05-29 15:28:35,1,0,1,Tomorrowland,Tomorrowland Original Ahhhh Original as oppose to a sequel
2015-05-29 15:29:40,1,0,1,Tomorrowland,I dont know if Tomorrowland is a really great example its not particularly well received by critics or viewers Rotten Tomatoes aggregate score 49
2015-05-29 15:29:44,3,0,3,Tomorrowland,Tomorrowlands marketing was extremely vague To the point where I have no idea what the movie is about in a bad way Ive also heard very meh things about it which is why Ill wait until its out of theaters
2015-05-29 15:29:51,1,0,1,Tomorrowland,Ill support original films that dont suck Tomorrowland was bad and promoted horribly
2015-05-29 15:29:53,3,0,3,Tomorrowland,I mention this above Tomorrowland wasnt inspired by the theme park It was inspired by Walt Disneys obsession with the future
2015-05-29 15:30:22,1,0,1,Tomorrowland,My SO wanted to see tomorrowland so we saw it yesterday Two 14 tickets  a 10 box of nachos  a 6 Icee and a mediocre movie later  and Im reminded that originality is not what keeps me from supporting movies
2015-05-29 15:31:34,9,0,9,Tomorrowland,Tomorrowland was originally a series of videos produced by Walt Disney about the future of science and technology Similar to the videos that Tony Starks dad made in Iron Man 2 that explained the arc reactor in the 60s The ride came after
2015-05-29 15:31:50,59,0,59,Tomorrowland,This is super accurate This is why I didnt go see the movie The trailers didnt say Dude you have to see this They said There is a film named Tomorrowland insert 10 if you want to know more
2015-05-29 15:33:03,1,0,1,Tomorrowland,gtIm using Tomorrowland as an example because its the most recent original movie to be made
2015-05-29 15:33:15,2,0,2,Tomorrowland,Tomorrowland was a series of Disney Produced Technology videos before the ride was even built
2015-05-29 15:34:50,0,0,0,Tomorrowland,My point is that the Tomorrowland movie is not a good example of originality and youre supporting my point in a way its not just a movie based on a ride its a movie based on a ride based on a series of old videos Thats not what I call originality More like derivation
2015-05-29 15:34:55,1,0,1,Tomorrowland,Tomorrowland was marketed terribly Ive never been to Disneyworld and am not a huge Disney person in general so I have no clue what the hell Tomorrowland is supposed to be and what the plot of the movie was supposed to be
2015-05-29 15:36:21,1,0,1,Tomorrowland,If this is about Tomorrowland all I know is I was forcefed 15 minutes of that crap before Fury Road and then had to see some guy Brad Bird make an awkward smile and he literally only said buy a ticket to Tomorrowland No thanks buddy
2015-05-29 15:37:10,1,0,1,Tomorrowland,A film should be judged on its intrinsic entertainment value alone Tomorrowland wasnt a great film so it shouldnt succeed as if it was one just because its original The article says it would have done much better if it did this or if it did that At the end of the day it didnt do any of these things and theres no points for nearly being a good film
2015-05-29 15:37:42,1,0,1,Tomorrowland,I dont understand this reasoning Help me get this mentality You wont see a bad movie How do you know its bad Just on reviews Sure I dont want to spend my money on crap but if a movie interests me Ill go see it regardless of the RottenTomato ratings I enjoyed Transcendence and it got shat on I think the most important factor for me to see a movie is the marketing behind it I was interested in seeing Tomorrowland but havent seen it because of the reviews and I live 15 hours away from a theater If it were just down the road I would have seen it Anyway I think we should see movies that interest us rather than rely on what others think
2015-05-29 15:42:57,1,0,1,Tomorrowland,Am I the only person that thought Tomorrowland was a good movie
2015-05-29 15:46:03,5,0,5,Tomorrowland,Tomorrowland isnt an attraction its a section of the park Just like Frontierland Fantasyland Adventureland and Main Street USA  Its just a name for the section that houses rides like Space Mountain Buzz Lightyears Space Ranger Spin Monsters Inc Laugh Factory and Stitchs Great Escape
2015-05-29 15:48:52,1,0,1,Tomorrowland,Id have watched Tomorrowland if it werent for Fury Road being in the cinema on the same day as well Glad I didnt watch Tomorrowland from the looks of it although theres a pretty high chance Id have still enjoyed it hell I enjoyed Chappie
2015-05-29 15:50:31,2,0,2,Tomorrowland,Is tomorrowland really as bad as everyone is saying it is I thought it looked kind of cool
2015-05-29 15:53:14,-3,0,-3,Tomorrowland,Its not that its an unoriginal movie but it still had a lot of help from the fact that people recognized a lot of what was in it especially from the trailers which featured the real video game characters heavily Just like how Tomorrowland is pretty original despite sharing a name with a famous ride
2015-05-29 15:53:29,3,0,3,Tomorrowland,gt  If we should be supporting original movies like Tomorrowland where was the outrage when Battleship sunk
2015-05-29 15:55:46,12,0,12,Tomorrowland,I bet on Tomorrowland because of Brad Bird but it just wasnt that good Fury Road on the other hand I ended up seeing three times because I kept taking people who hadnt seen it Enjoyed it every time
2015-05-29 15:56:57,15,0,15,Tomorrowland,Tomorrowland looks mediocre
2015-05-29 16:00:46,1,0,1,Tomorrowland,Tomorrowland not succeeding is not a result of it being a new idea Its a result of it being a Disney movie Im an adult not a child Im not going to spend my money on a childrens film
2015-05-29 16:01:31,1,0,1,Tomorrowland,You cant really compare tomorrowland and battleship Battleship was a terrible terrible movie from start to finish It was probably the worst movie I saw all year
2015-05-29 16:01:40,17,0,17,Tomorrowland,Im really not even sure why were supposed to cheer for saving Tomorrowland in the first place
2015-05-29 16:01:45,1,0,1,Tomorrowland,I think Tomorrowland had a marketingmessaging issue Based on the trailers Id seen I assumed it was at LEAST PG13 possibly R Definitely didnt seem like a movie youd take your kids to with the explosions and apparent teen angst in the trailers I was surprised to see recently that its actually rated PG So yeah Im not sure who Tomorrowland is actually targeted to And if its families I think they missed the mark with their marketing
2015-05-29 16:02:13,1,0,1,Tomorrowland,Lol How much did this guy get to write this tomorrowland fluff piece
2015-05-29 16:02:35,3,0,3,Tomorrowland,Thats true but Brad Bird has already shown us that he can make movies for kids and adults at the same time Sadly Tomorrowland doesnt work as well as his previous efforts
2015-05-29 16:05:54,-1,0,-1,Tomorrowland,This article is bullshit and is attempting to guilt trip me into believing its bullshit I will GLADLY go see an original film if it interests me Tomorrowland simply did not Clearly I am not alone
2015-05-29 16:06:00,0,0,0,Tomorrowland,How is Tomorrowland original in any way its based off a ride at Disney World Its like calling Pirates of the Caribbean original
2015-05-29 16:06:04,1,0,1,Tomorrowland,I havent seen Ex Machina but by most accounts it seems like a better argument than Tomorrowland
2015-05-29 16:09:24,1,0,1,Tomorrowland,I thought Tomorrowland was great
2015-05-29 16:11:42,-2,0,-2,Tomorrowland,Reasons I didnt see Tomorrowland
2015-05-29 16:14:11,-5,0,-5,Tomorrowland,But Fury Road was worse than Tomorrowland
2015-05-29 16:20:55,-1,0,-1,Tomorrowland,I opted not to see Tomorrowland due to mediocre reviews I did however see Mad Max twice last weekend I havent seen Tomorrowland but Mad Max was a massive departure from typical action movies
2015-05-29 16:27:55,4,0,4,Tomorrowland,In Tomorrowland they really try to shove it down our throats like to the point of calling people who disbelieve in climate change and whathaveyou as idiots deserving of their fates I mean really I dont disagree that a lot of those people are idiots but youre not winning over any new friends with that attitude
2015-05-29 16:28:52,8,0,8,Tomorrowland,Theres no Tomorrowland ride that the movie is based on I havent seen it yet but to my understanding its based around the ideology that Walt Disney based the Tomorrowland part of Disneyland a specific section of the park with multiple attractions on
2015-05-29 16:30:26,-1,0,-1,Tomorrowland,If original films want my support they have to be good Also Tomorrowland is full of people taking extacy and having sex what kind of a sick fuck makes that into a kids movie
2015-05-29 16:30:47,1,0,1,Tomorrowland,If they wanted Tomorrowland to succeed maybe at least one of the trailers could have given me an idea of what the fuck that movie was even about
2015-05-29 16:31:03,-1,0,-1,Tomorrowland,Does Tomorrowland really qualify as an original film Its essentially an attempt by Disney to rebrand an area of their theme park the same way they did the Pirates of the Caribbean Maybe I shouldnt prejudge it based on that but it rubs me the wrong way
2015-05-29 16:34:18,1,0,1,Tomorrowland,If anything the film was inspired by quote at the entrance to Tomorrowland at Disneyland
2015-05-29 16:36:51,0,0,0,Tomorrowland,Using Tomorrowland for the basis of this argument is like the two dudes fighting over the Jokers broken pool cue
2015-05-29 16:38:54,1,0,1,Tomorrowland,My only complaint with tomorrowland was how preachy it ended up being
2015-05-29 16:42:51,2,0,2,Tomorrowland,Agree saw Mad Max last week in 3D and loved every moment of it  Wanted to watch it again this time in IMAX and saw Tomorrowland had taken over all IMAX screens Disappointed
2015-05-29 16:44:01,1,0,1,Tomorrowland,If everyone here who is saying the movie was bad actually saw Tomorrowland then I imagine the movie would have made a bit more money than it has
2015-05-29 16:45:09,2,0,2,Tomorrowland,If you want original films to make money you have to make good original films  Not like Tomorrowland and Jupiter Ascending
2015-05-29 16:47:25,-1,0,-1,Tomorrowland,Tomorrowland is a bust can we stop treating Clowney and his wife like royalty yet
2015-05-29 16:47:39,1,0,1,Tomorrowland,I think the problem was the marketing  I think most people have no idea what Tomorrowland is about or why they should go see it  The average American doesnt know who Brad Bird is but if you say from the director of The Incredibles suddenly you have their interest
2015-05-29 16:51:18,1,0,1,Tomorrowland,Yeah Tomorrowland is a pretty average film Its 100 aimed at kids w nothing at all to entertain the parents Theres huge plot holes questionable choices by characters required to move things along and just a general saccharine quality to the entire endeavor Plus its based on a friggin amusement park ride Exactly how is that original
2015-05-29 16:51:19,-1,0,-1,Tomorrowland,I wanted to see Tomorrowland but when I heard it had climate change dogma crap I said no way  What we have to do is stop the bs indoctrination in films
2015-05-29 16:52:54,1,0,1,Tomorrowland,If they want us to go to original films they should make them good Tomorrowland looked terrible
2015-05-29 16:53:27,1,0,1,Tomorrowland,ITT People shitting on Tomorrowland I havent seen it yet but Im excited about it Just because it has the same name as a land in the theme park doesnt mean its not an original movieconcept Based on my understanding of the movie it has nothing to do with the theme park other than a few easter eggs
2015-05-29 16:53:54,1,0,1,Tomorrowland,I saw Tomorrowland It needs a recut that is at least 20 minutes shorter There is to much exposition that seems to go nowhere until the end of the film
2015-05-29 16:53:56,1,0,1,Tomorrowland,I saw Tomorrowland It needs a recut that is at least 20 minutes shorter There is to much exposition that seems to go nowhere until the end of the film
2015-05-29 16:54:59,1,0,1,Tomorrowland,Dredd anyone TomorrowLand is a terrible example
2015-05-29 16:57:27,1,0,1,Tomorrowland,Thats valid I just wish people would at least give a little credit for originality Yes Tomorrowlands a movie inspired by the Disney Theme Park but there are a ton of fun original things in it and yeah it has pacing issues but that doesnt mean the whole movie is crap
2015-05-29 16:57:35,1,0,1,Tomorrowland,Funny how this entire reddit thread is bashing Tomorrowland Tomorrowland was a gamble Regardless if you think is a good or bad movie Disneys not going to take another chance on original content for a while and thats the point You want original content but you dont want to go see the movies that are
2015-05-29 17:00:08,1,0,1,Tomorrowland,Yeah I agree I just meant in the context of some movies and tomorrowland I feel like ive heard a lot about tomorrowland is great for kids and I thought that was a cop out
2015-05-29 17:00:25,0,0,0,Tomorrowland,Im all for sense of wonder and imagination but Tomorrowland havent seen it looks like an arbitrary adventure film The trailers were vague and literally told you nothing about the plot
2015-05-29 17:02:45,4,0,4,Tomorrowland,I was just thinking to myself that I have no idea what Tomorrowland is even about The previews are just long first look at one of the action scenes along with some other scenes that are cool but tell me nothing about the plot And then I realized its a Lindelof movie so of course the previews show me cool stuff but no plot because thats all it actually is
2015-05-29 17:03:19,1,0,1,Tomorrowland,Not to be reductive but this article sounds like a Brad Bird fan whining about how nobody else liked Tomorrowland
2015-05-29 17:03:33,1,0,1,Tomorrowland,The author of this article clearly has no idea of what constitutes an original film idea or even what constitutes a good movie for that matter Im sure Tomorrowland is enjoyable but it certainly isnt any kind of antithesis to the recycled crap Hollywood churns out lately
2015-05-29 17:03:53,1,0,1,Tomorrowland,I think the problem with Tomorrowland was the promotion  The trailers did nothing to attract my interest  It seems that either they did not have a clear idea what the movie was about or and this is my strong dislike for Lindlelof showing they could not come up with promotion that was interesting because the plot of the movie is so vague
2015-05-29 17:05:05,1,0,1,Tomorrowland,I agree with everything this guy is saying Except that hes using Tomorrowland as an example  It was like a live action version of every Disney movie  follow your dreams work hard never give up and you can be whatever you want to be  It was a little sickening to be honest  The movie was visually and conceptually cool but it lost me with the delivery  I felt like I was getting preached at with that Clooneyesque flair  I agree with ihateredd1t that John Wick is a much better example of an original Hollywood movie that was good and loved by a lot of people
2015-05-29 17:05:22,1,0,1,Tomorrowland,Tomorrowland is really good
2015-05-29 17:05:32,7,0,7,Tomorrowland,I dont think youre really appreciating what Mad Max did right and Tomorrowland did wrong
2015-05-29 17:06:53,1,0,1,Tomorrowland,Tomorrowland was a niche movie just like John Carter The only people who are going to appreciate them are people who are familiar with the background of the movie Sadly this movie was going to cater to the people who love the theme parks which is a lot of people but not everyone
2015-05-29 17:07:28,1,0,1,Tomorrowland,First of all calling Tomorrowland an original movie might be a bit of a stretch Yes it isnt a reboot or a remake but Disney is one of the biggest offenders of cranking out rehashed movies in Hollywood
2015-05-29 17:07:29,0,0,0,Tomorrowland,If you want to support original film making go see Mad Max Thats fresh and original AND a great movie through and through unlike Tomorrowland which is amazing for visuals but extremely lacking in pretty much everything else
2015-05-29 17:08:26,2,0,2,Tomorrowland,Im not comparing Mad Max and Tomorrowlands story telling Im criticizing Mad Maxs action scenes only on its own terms outside of comparing it to other things The person I responded to said Its action scenes are innovative exciting and tactile and I openly and strongly disagree with the former two adjectives
2015-05-29 17:11:28,1,0,1,Tomorrowland,I saw Tomorrowland It needs a recut that is at least 20 minutes shorter There is to much exposition that seems to go nowhere until the end of the film
2015-05-29 17:11:57,1,0,1,Tomorrowland,Dont let these people give you the wrong idea They all seem to have forgotten how to just sit down and enjoy a movie and have fun with it I thought Tomorrowland was great and actually really inspiring
2015-05-29 17:15:36,2,0,2,Tomorrowland,Tomorrowland 2 would have been spent in the actual place
2015-05-29 17:16:58,1,0,1,Tomorrowland,We dont want original content we want good movies We dont want some pointless blockbuster but something well thought out and done well Sure this is original but so was Pacific Rim and The Expendables Those were trash and they will all conjure up sequels Tomorrowland would have done the same if it was done well It is the studio system and the way that it operates that is the problem We want good movies not this
2015-05-29 17:17:38,1,0,1,Tomorrowland,Not if they suck  And from what I understand Tomorrowland sucked badly and they didnt advertise for itbecause it sucked badly  Thats my fault  Fuck you
2015-05-29 17:19:22,5,0,5,Tomorrowland,Tomorrowland felt like a movie that wanted to be an animated movie but wasnt The dialogue was cheesy and the message by the end of the film came off as heavyhanded and forced It was merely mediocre by my standards Cant really say I agree with the opinion of the OPs review but I liked hearing a different perspective from someone who did
2015-05-29 17:20:20,9,0,9,Tomorrowland,You say that like it was solely Lindelofs fault that Prometheus sucked Ridley was the captain of that ship he had final say on everything and the guy was simply following Ridleys every bark and command Same thing with Tomorrowland too If you visit the Official Discussion thread for that movie everyone keeps laying the blame on Lindelof and how he tarnished Brad Birds spotless career Lindelof who cowrote Tomorrowland somehow gets the brunt of the finger pointing and nerd outrage while Bird who produced wrote and directed the movie gets away scotfree Yeah right
2015-05-29 17:20:20,0,0,0,Tomorrowland,Tomorrowland was supposed to be original
2015-05-29 17:22:37,2,0,2,Tomorrowland,Well thats you He has fans Many fans in fact Im not saying I follow every movie or show hes involved with in face I didnt even know he had anything to do with Tomorrowland until someone said Oh fuck Lindeloff is involved I wont see this
2015-05-29 17:22:54,4,0,4,Tomorrowland,Except it wasnt very fun You spend at most 10 minutes in the Tomorrowland you thought youd see going into the movie and then its a drab tale about getting to the broken down Tomorrowland
2015-05-29 17:24:27,1,0,1,Tomorrowland,gtIt was for kids definitely but anyone seeing it was from Disney and seeing the Tomorrowland logo should have expected that
2015-05-29 17:25:09,2,0,2,Tomorrowland,Tomorrowland is not an attraction its a land Tomorrowland is based on an alternate universe where all the great minds were able to travel to to innovate and create what they wanted to without interference from government and such
2015-05-29 17:26:45,1,0,1,Tomorrowland,Maybe if Tomorrowland wasnt written by the worst hack writer in Hollywood I would be more interested  Maybe the problem with original IPs isnt the IP but the people associate with them
2015-05-29 17:27:30,1,0,1,Tomorrowland,The disease of Lindelof overpowers any director Remember when Lindelof wrote a film by Ridley Scott Yea dont see Tomorrowland
2015-05-29 17:29:44,8,0,8,Tomorrowland,It became a ghost town because Lauries character closed the doors to that dimension People eventually died He wanted to keep Tomorrowland all to himself Also Tomorrowland takes place in 1964 all the way to the present
2015-05-29 17:30:04,1,0,1,Tomorrowland,Yeah Tomorrowland was mainly Disney Porn and product placement I saw it last night It was cute but the story was contrived and nonsensical I support that it trys to get kids to dream and be scientists and shit Bill Nye would approve but it wasnt a good movie
2015-05-29 17:30:05,0,0,0,Tomorrowland,This is why Ive not had any interest in Tomorrowland  The name alone makes it sound like itll be some formulaic crap  POTC was an outlier in a group of bad ideas for movies based on theme park rides
2015-05-29 17:30:16,5,0,5,Tomorrowland,And I think thats totally fair  Opinions and all  When I think of a terrible movie I think of a movie thats halfassed Not well made and no care put into the script camera work blocking acting etc  Tomorrowland is not that in my opinion
2015-05-29 17:31:10,8,0,8,Tomorrowland,Charming but totally dispensable I was confused as to why the thing that got them to Paris didnt take them to Tomorrowland Seemed totally forced
2015-05-29 17:32:51,2,0,2,Tomorrowland,THERE IS NO TOMORROWLAND RIDE ITS A SECTION OF THE PARK
2015-05-29 17:33:55,0,0,0,Tomorrowland,Honestly this is such a pretentious argument Its akin to you just dont get it Tomorrowland was really really terrible Extremely boring thin plot too long too preachy and they didnt explore Tomorrowland at all in the film This isnt even factoring in that the trailer was the most cryptic useless promo material Ive seen in a long time Also the whole wolf motif made me want to shoot myself in the face every time it was mentionedTomorrowland failed for many reasons its originality is not one of them
2015-05-29 17:39:30,2,0,2,Tomorrowland,DayAfterTomorrowland
2015-05-29 17:40:00,2,0,2,Tomorrowland,I saw an extended like 10 minute preview of Tomorrowland in theaters and it looked like shit honestly
2015-05-29 17:40:10,0,0,0,Tomorrowland,I already saw Max Max decades ago  so I chose to see Tomorrowland instead  Love that Clooney
2015-05-29 17:40:23,6,0,6,Tomorrowland,did you actually watch tomorrowland
2015-05-29 17:41:20,1,0,1,Tomorrowland,I dont think Tomorrowland is as bad of a movie as everyone is claiming It was a mediocre movie What else was everyone expecting from Disney Is it an original movie Meh not really at least in some parts but I couldnt definitively say being that I havent watched every film ever made On that note I would argue that no film is completely original because the idea had to come from somewhere be inspired by something Man the people in this thread Things dont have to either be bad or good most things lie in the spectrum between Originality is the same Stop being a bunch of babies
2015-05-29 17:42:23,2,0,2,Tomorrowland,Tomorrowland looked like garbage though
2015-05-29 17:44:09,1,0,1,Tomorrowland,Also Tomorrowland is a section of the theme park at Disney World Original concept
2015-05-29 17:44:17,2,0,2,Tomorrowland,I am so freaking tired of the guilt trip over box office Its hack at this point Tomorrowland is the lynchpin for original films now Really a movie based on a ride at Disneyland
2015-05-29 17:45:30,1,0,1,Tomorrowland,I saw Tomorrowland  It was OK  I hoped for more and I feel like it underdelivered  Could have done much more with the premise
2015-05-29 17:45:58,1,0,1,Tomorrowland,This whole articles premise is skewed Tomorrowland was based on a well known Disney property directed by a big name director and will likely be turned into a franchise if it finds its footing similar to what happened with Pirates of the Caribbean Id like more original films but this is maybe the worst example that could have been used
2015-05-29 17:46:27,2,0,2,Tomorrowland,I really enjoyed Tomorrowlands message and tone but its apparent that it went through a troubled development
2015-05-29 17:47:08,1,0,1,Tomorrowland,Uggh More studios need to get this Tomorrowland didnt flop because it had a female protagonist or because the marketing wasnt great it failed because its story sucked and was boring and trite
2015-05-29 17:48:06,5,0,5,Tomorrowland,I really wanted to like Tomorrowland and Brad Bird is a brilliant director but the writing Why does Damon Lindelof still get work It baffles me
2015-05-29 17:48:34,1,0,1,Tomorrowland,If all the people in here that are ripping on Tomorrowland actually saw it the box office wouldve been much better
2015-05-29 17:48:41,0,0,0,Tomorrowland,havnt seen Tomorrowland butwell I just know its not gonna be an original hit Whiplash was an original hitso was Birdmanhell those got plenty of supportId like to see support for foreign and independent filmsWhy is it I can go to the cinema to see another SHIT comedy or romance or action and yet I know I wont see koreas best movies that year or japans maybe just maybe I will see a studio ghibli film a cannes winner etc last year many amazing films didnt get wide release they were original but more importantly GOOD
2015-05-29 17:49:42,1,0,1,Tomorrowland,But Tomorrowland was good
2015-05-29 17:50:58,1,0,1,Tomorrowland,I wanted to see Tomorrowland because I wanted to see Tomorrowland I wanted to zoom and fly around this futuristic city I wanted to see smart people and futur technologies ala The Worlds Fair brilliant imaginings and What Ifs What I got was 99 of the movie set in a forest swamp wheat field or bleak future wasteland That is not at all why I signed up If the third act had been a huge fanciful battle of good vs evil in the Tomorrowland we were promised I would of been satisfied
2015-05-29 17:50:59,1,0,1,Tomorrowland,Well the point of encouraging audiences to change their behavior is to adjust what produces a hit movie  If audiences avoid stuff which gets mediocre reviews and seems to simply aim for mediocrity eg Tomorrowland San Andreas Transformers movies etc then those things will make less money and be less likely to get made
2015-05-29 17:52:07,1,0,1,Tomorrowland,Yeah this guys entire article hinges on that film too You didnt see Tomorrowland so now we cant have nice things Bullshit And while Tomorrowland TL was arguably an original script Disney still used the parks name  how is that not a builtin market
2015-05-29 17:52:28,1,0,1,Tomorrowland,Im convinced that this If we want original films we have to support them viral articles was fabricated and disseminated by someone in marketing at Disney Its so obviously designed to try to give 2nd week bump to Tomorrowlands box office totals This has got to be one of the most moronic discussions that I have seen as there is no shortage of original films
2015-05-29 17:53:10,1,0,1,Tomorrowland,Its pretty much what I got from that article Ive never heard of Tomorrowland now I think Ill go see it after work
2015-05-29 17:54:33,2,0,2,Tomorrowland,When did Tomorrowland become a fucking ride Its an entire section of the park or has no one actually been to Disney
2015-05-29 17:55:59,4,0,4,Tomorrowland,Tomorrowland was a good movie It was very fun to see in theaters Whimsical adventurous It felt like a liveaction version of an animated Disney film The art design is interestingits a beautiful film that looks like it benefited greatly from the massive budget it had There WERE a couple of problems The biggest problem was that it got overly convoluted towards the end I feel like they could have come up with a much more basic reason as the motivation for the antagonist Also spoilers the robot girls death scene went on too long But every film has problems so thats fine I think people are being way too hard on Tomorrowland It should have at least gotten a fresh rating on Rotten Tomatoes I think most of the Redditor who are talking bad about the film probably havent seen it Peoples opinions are being manipulated by what has already been said rather than thinking for themselves Just like a Redditors decision to updownvote a comment is often times based on whether or not that comment already has positive or negative karmathe hivemind
2015-05-29 17:57:36,4,0,4,Tomorrowland,Its another circlejerk People not really judging the movie as it is Tomorrowland is bad just like how Pacific Rim is the second coming of Christ according to rmovies
2015-05-29 17:58:25,2,0,2,Tomorrowland,I swear Im the only person or critic that really enjoyed Tomorrowland

2015-05-29 18:02:56,1,0,1,Tomorrowland,and they use Tomorrowland as an example Even if the movie turns out alright you can not use a hack idiot script writer like Damon Lindelof as an example of a movie that is original The guy hasnt had an original thought in his life nor has he ever written anything of quality He is the reason that Prometheus is the train wreck that it is I believe a death penalty is in order
2015-05-29 18:03:02,2,0,2,Tomorrowland,I support good movies not just original ones Mad Max Fury Road was a rebootsequelremakeit is really unclear how this film relates to the other films but it is the best movie I have seen all year Being original is not the same thing as being good Tomorrowland is not the only original film playing right now There is also the Rocks San Andreas Rotten Tomatoes rate it 51 2 higher than Tomorrowland andAloha which is only 14
2015-05-29 18:04:38,2,0,2,Tomorrowland,They also say at the start of that paragraph that it is based on the attraction Tomorrowland which is not an attraction but an area of the park Plus if you want to make an argument for originality in film dont pick a film based on anything Jupiter Rising was an original concept and a fun film if not deeply flawed but it makes a much better case for the lack of support for new concepts than a Disney theme park film
2015-05-29 18:04:47,3,0,3,Tomorrowland,There is nothing in Tomorrowland that you could rightfully call an adaptation of the Tomorrowlands in the parks  The movie sort of vaguely references it here and there thats it
2015-05-29 18:06:14,1,0,1,Tomorrowland,I dont know the exact numbers but it seems like original films have been on the rise in the last few years Granted the quality varies but off the top of my head Grand Budapest Hotel Tomorrowland Ex Machina John Wick  The Raid Redemption Unfriended Frozen Transcendence Earth to Echo Interstellar Chappie The Man with the Iron Fists Green Inferno Tammy Jupiter Ascending Pixels The Hateful Eight etc Like I said varying quality and I guess success but mostly successful
2015-05-29 18:08:32,1,0,1,Tomorrowland,When I read that article I saw actually thinking of Tomorrowland 2 3 and 4
2015-05-29 18:08:41,1,0,1,Tomorrowland,I did support Tomorrowland I went and saw it There are great things in it It just sort of lost its way though I mainly blame Lindelof
2015-05-29 18:08:54,1,0,1,Tomorrowland,I might as well take this opportunity to say that Tomorrowland came off as very smug
2015-05-29 18:14:00,1,0,1,Tomorrowland,Tomorrowland 2 Even Tomorrower
2015-05-29 18:16:21,1,0,1,Tomorrowland,Im assuming thats Disney world Tomorrowland at Disneyland has no monsters inc or stichs escape
2015-05-29 18:20:49,-2,0,-2,Tomorrowland,TIL Tomorrowland is not something interesting or enjoyable that people want to visithttpwwwmerriamwebstercomdictionaryattraction Someone should probably tell Disney that because the movie they named after their notanattraction will not boost Disneyland ticket sales and Tomorrowland should probably be torn down because no one wants to go there anyway

2015-05-29 18:21:40,1,0,1,Tomorrowland,I was thinking that if even one person said something positive about Tomorrowland Ill seriously consider watching it Did you enjoy watching it  Even supposedly bad movies have a group of people that enjoy it
2015-05-29 18:22:49,3,0,3,Tomorrowland,I feel like the vast majority of people in here saying Ill support an original movie if it was good havent seen Tomorrowland I thoroughly enjoyed it personally I just kind of think that audiences have been trained to see dark gritty edgy as good and if you dont make a movie like that it better be damn compelling or you wont even get an audience before they take what the critics have said and move on
2015-05-29 18:23:12,1,0,1,Tomorrowland,All I could think was that it had a good premise but they should have committed to making it into two movies The first one being about the boy leaving Tomorrowland and the second about his return
2015-05-29 18:24:15,54,0,54,Tomorrowland,Thats probably why it got greenlit but thats not why people liked it Tomorrowland was a _kids_ film I dont think kids are the ones complaining about the lack of originality
2015-05-29 18:26:30,2,0,2,Tomorrowland,I personally see no issue with Tomorrowland

2015-05-29 18:29:00,1,0,1,Tomorrowland,Whats wrong with tomorrowland I was thinking about seeing it this weekend
2015-05-29 18:29:33,1,0,1,Tomorrowland,Tomorrowland was probably the worst movie Ive seen in 5 years  What a stupid article
2015-05-29 18:30:24,0,0,0,Tomorrowland,But this is the entire point of the phrase original film Is it based on some existing property or not If it is based on an existing property then its not an original film Tomorrowland is a wellknown section of a popular theme park Its not an original film
2015-05-29 18:31:20,1,0,1,Tomorrowland,The problem with Tomorrowland is the marketing What makes me want to see it Girl finds pin that transports here to different place finds a guy who that happened too as well bad things ensue  I need to want to see a movie and know a little bit about it before I spend 12 bucks to see it
2015-05-29 18:32:17,2,0,2,Tomorrowland,The trailer I remember best is the one at the bad guys meeting Later trailers I know featured scenes with QBert Like I said the movie is original but it still advertised its adapted characters so people became more interested in it because they recognized a lot of the real video game characters in the movie Sort of like how someone might go see Tomorrowland because they liked the ride its named after even though it has hardly anything to do with it
2015-05-29 18:36:21,1,0,1,Tomorrowland,The Mission to Mars movie was based on the old Mission to Mars ride which was part of Tomorrowland in Disneyland and part of the Magic Kingdom in Disney World Mission SPACE was a newer ride in EPCOT
2015-05-29 18:38:30,1,0,1,Tomorrowland,I wholehearted agree that if we want original films we need to go out and support them with our ticket dollars That being said I think Tomorrowland is a poor example of this Its everything that makes me dislike most huge budget blockbusters The script is poorly paced the dialog is painfully expository and artificial and the visual effects while very technically cool feel like they are there to show off more than move the story forward or develop the characters Oh and also that completely unapologetic product placement for CocaCola right after they get out of the teleportation device one of the stupidest things Ive seen in a theater in years
2015-05-29 18:38:40,1,0,1,Tomorrowland,I saw tomorrowland and it was really really bad Im down for an original movie but lets shoot higher than that
2015-05-29 18:40:27,1,0,1,Tomorrowland,Is this a stand on movie blandness or an add for Tomorrowland The author makes great points but this seems rhailcorporate to me The same arguments could be said about Edge of Tomorrow for example
2015-05-29 18:45:35,1,0,1,Tomorrowland,Tomorrowland is based on a theme park
2015-05-29 18:46:44,3,0,3,Tomorrowland,I didnt see Tomorrowland because Damon Lindelof was involved Previews looked good but once I found out that assclown was involved I said NOPE
2015-05-29 18:46:46,1,0,1,Tomorrowland,How is this rhailcorporate Because the guy liked Tomorrowland

2015-05-29 18:50:39,1,0,1,Tomorrowland,Im actually looking forward to seeing Tomorrowland but I just dont go to the movies much anymore Its too expensive and not worth it to me in the long run So when I do go I want the movie I see to blow me away

2015-05-29 18:54:52,0,0,0,Tomorrowland,This dude must be getting paid by Disney First tomorrowland was just one really long advertisement for a theme park and soft drinks Second there is no real lack of original movies especially in a generation where film festivals are covered main stream media outlets  This is not good
2015-05-29 18:55:11,1,0,1,Tomorrowland,Primarily because of the distance between me and the theater as you so read I choose Mad Max over Tomorrowland because of the reviews but if I lived closer I would have seen both of them Since they both piqued my interest I would have seen them if I had the time
2015-05-29 18:55:27,2,0,2,Tomorrowland,The thing is what is expected from Disney and Brad Bird and George Clooney is different than what was expected with a movie about robots there was hype because Del Toro made it but not as much as what people were expecting from Tomorrowland I havent seen both movies btw
2015-05-29 18:58:22,1,0,1,Tomorrowland,Tomorrowland would have been a better film if it didnt flash forward to present day and focus on the girl If it had stayed with the kid who grew up to be George Clooney and been about his adventure in Tomorrowland and proving himself to be every bit as special as the handpicked people Conflict ensues kid makes new friends saves Tomorrowland etc
2015-05-29 19:01:20,1,0,1,Tomorrowland,Well thats not really a good analogy either youre massively oversimplifying the process to make a point This is Disney we are talking about makers of Fantasia Snow White I will argue anyone to the ground who says they dont have a creative process that is more complicated than Lets make a movie based on our theme parks By the way this isnt even based on the theme park area that is Tomorrowland its based on Walts fascination and passion for futuristic technology and using it to change the world in which we live
2015-05-29 19:01:30,1,0,1,Tomorrowland,The quote embodies what Tomorrowland should be but if we compare the Tomorrowland of today with the Tomorrowland of the midlate 60s we see very different places indeed Today the focus is on science fantasy with attractions like Buzz Lightyear Star Tours and Finding Nemo but with the focus after the remodel in the 60s was of a world on the move This period saw the addition of the People Mover the Monorail the Rocket Jets Adventures through Inner Space and the Carousel of Progress among many others The attractions in Tomorrowland tried to inspire entertain and educate park guests todays attractions only seek to entertain and no longer seek to inspire guests about the hope of a peaceful and unified world
2015-05-29 19:01:36,1,0,1,Tomorrowland,Its probably not but it seems funny because hes like one of the reasons i liked tomorrowland so much and starts talking about what he liked about the film rather than support his original conjecture of current movies lacking originality
2015-05-29 19:01:45,1,0,1,Tomorrowland,Risky is a better word here Disney spent a lot of money on something that was hard to sell outside of George Clooney George Clooney is pretty hard to sell to kids too They took the same risk with John Carter and made a amazing movie that was better than Avatar  but didnt make Avatar money I really like the idea of Tomorrowland but this just isnt something Ill see in a theater
2015-05-29 19:03:18,1,0,1,Tomorrowland,My point is Tomorrowland isnt a brand It was originally an idea of a world that was forward thinking when it came to society and technology IE A land of tomorrow
2015-05-29 19:08:11,2,0,2,Tomorrowland,Tomorrowland Procrastynation
2015-05-29 19:09:44,1,0,1,Tomorrowland,Some movies can rely on names  marketing or association but an original or mostly original IP they relies on the Disney name alone is clearly not a guaranteed success This is obvious since Tomorrowland may not break even It had Disneys name decent trailers imo and a known actor So I would suggest they focus on quality a bit more At least on their original IPs
2015-05-29 19:10:21,2,0,2,Tomorrowland,I enjoyed Tomorrowland The message fit my headspace perfectly The execution was a bit clunky in parts but other films with even bigger dead spots have been very popular
2015-05-29 19:10:33,1,0,1,Tomorrowland,Bird recently made both The Incredibles and Ratatouille and they were original ideas and big successes It just so happens to be that Tomorrowland wasnt as good
2015-05-29 19:14:26,2,0,2,Tomorrowland,Tomorrowland was also marketed poorly  The reviews have been lukewarm but not bad and a lot of articles came out on Friday telling parents not to take their kids because it was too violent and scary  Brad Bird does this  look at the body count in The Incredibles  but in a liveaction venue seeing police officers get disintegrated by killer robots was a bit too much for a lot of people

2015-05-29 19:26:17,1,0,1,Tomorrowland,I loved Tomorrowland and am sad that so many people several of which havent even seen it are so eager to bash it but thats whats great about movies  what is crap for some is a fun adventure for others
2015-05-29 19:26:33,1,0,1,Tomorrowland,gtThe main characters also walked into the Tomorrowland and saw that it was a disappointing husk of what couldve been The ads and the movie were like the pins and the Tomorrowland itself
2015-05-29 19:26:57,1,0,1,Tomorrowland,Im not going to get hung up on the chosen example by the author here I also think Tomorrowland was terrible but I paid to see it anyway because it looked interesting and imaginative and had brad bird as a director I support this general principle though  I havent seen Age of Ultron or Fast 7 I only saw Mad Max because it did action without exclusively throwing CGI on the screen I saw Pacific Rim because it looked dope and was fresh also I really liked it
2015-05-29 19:27:22,1,0,1,Tomorrowland,I go to the cinema every weekend with my dad We did not see a single trailer for Tomorrowland in the months leading up to its release I saw no buzz for it on the internet either It carries the name of a techno music festival and has a cryptic poster
2015-05-29 19:27:42,1,0,1,Tomorrowland,How Tomorrowland got greenlit for that big of budget is beyond me

2015-05-29 19:32:42,8,0,8,Tomorrowland,The movie acts like an advertisement for Tomorrowland at Disneyland Haha what As if nobody has heard of Disneyland Its more like they used the name Tomorrowland to sell a movie
2015-05-29 19:33:35,1,0,1,Tomorrowland,Unfortunately you would have needed to read the prequel novel they put out as part of the movie promotion which no one heard about Tomorrowland is located on a planet in deep space practically a duplicate of earth Its reached via some sort of dimensional folding FTL The robots are also in the book and after the initial colonization attempt at Tomorrowland there was an accident and the entire city had to be rebuilt decontaminated by robots or to be more specific androids And even back then they had the same creepy smile
2015-05-29 19:38:40,3,0,3,Tomorrowland,I thought Tomorrowland was also really good

2015-05-29 19:43:24,2,0,2,Tomorrowland,Tomorrowland is his example really That film was made to sell the theme park in Disneyworld Lets not pretend that it came from a script that had a soul The emphasis was on big effects and wow factor to match the theme park The first teaser was better than the film itself and when the actual trailer was released it looked like an entirely different film
2015-05-29 19:46:50,1,0,1,Tomorrowland,CMV i liked tomorrowland
2015-05-29 19:47:12,1,0,1,Tomorrowland,gtIm using Tomorrowland as an example because its the most recent original movie to be made
2015-05-29 19:56:18,1,0,1,Tomorrowland,Tomorrowland was actually pretty decent and with mad max doing so well which it should be its amazing the message of Tomorrowland is actually even more relevant
2015-05-29 19:57:26,2,0,2,Tomorrowland,gtMy point is Tomorrowland isnt a brand
2015-05-29 19:57:29,1,0,1,Tomorrowland,Really really tried to watch Tomorrowland  Gave up after the 1st 45 minutes
2015-05-29 19:57:49,1,0,1,Tomorrowland,Tomorrowland might be fucking great Honestly the trailer featuring Clooney and some girl picking up some random trinkets from a police department then lots of special effects with no basic premise whatsoever didnt exactly pull me in
2015-05-29 20:01:06,2,0,2,Tomorrowland,Being original is important but that alone does not obligate me to see it in theaters Tomorrowland may be original and yes I want original films but Im not going to throw my money at every unique film that hits theaters Nextflix is rife with original films that are absolutely terrible Being original is not enough Tomorrowland didnt appeal to me for several reasons
2015-05-29 20:11:19,1,0,1,Tomorrowland,Tomorrowland is kinda a flawed film really tho I mean its nice how optimistic it is but despite than the film just isnt that fun once you get past like the first hour or so
2015-05-29 20:11:24,1,0,1,Tomorrowland,Tomorrowland was a horrible example of original movie The main problem is that it had no clear target aurdience I cant even say it was family friendly when cops are disintegrated or when a humanoid has his head repeatedly bashed scene closer to Drive than Parent Trap
2015-05-29 20:15:35,1,0,1,Tomorrowland,The problem is people wont support a movie that the word of mouth has already tanked Tomorrowland is probably Birds weakest film to date and how the hell it cost 180m is beyond me it sure doesnt look like it Originality isnt the flicks problem its story and performance quality
2015-05-29 20:18:00,1,0,1,Tomorrowland,My problem with Tomorrowland is the fact that there is literally no source material in the thing they are trying to make
2015-05-29 20:19:36,1,0,1,Tomorrowland,I just watched Tomorrowland last night  I have to say its quite possibly one of the best movies Ive seen in awhile
2015-05-29 20:22:28,1,0,1,Tomorrowland,You are defining bomb as being the 1 box office hit on a holiday weekend  OK then  Also  Tomorrowland was good  It wasnt great but it was typical Disney good  Maybe you wouldnt want to see it but your average family would take their kids to see it and enjoy it  Thats the target audience
2015-05-29 20:26:30,1,0,1,Tomorrowland,The writer would have made a better case using critically wellreceived Edge of Tomorrow instead of Tomorrowland which was trashed by critics  EoT did have the big production budget and mass advertising but still failed at the US box office  Im still at a loss for why  Was it just poorly advertised or a silent boycott by antiCruise fans   Surely the confirmation by moviegoers should have helped the movie after the opening weekend where it came in 3rd behind Malificent and that somethingsomethingStars movie
2015-05-29 20:29:11,1,0,1,Tomorrowland,While it carried a wonderful message which is the only reason I can think of besides a big paycheck that enticed Clooney into starring Tomorrowland didnt fail because it was original and it is not as though people arent seeing it or liking it because it is an original idea its because the quality of the story and acting was awful It was heartbreaking for me to sit through the entire movie and then see that Brad Bird had directed it after hes done such uplifting and well written films in the past
2015-05-29 20:34:15,1,0,1,Tomorrowland,I liked Tomorrowland a good amount the last act kinda threw it off for me but I thought the rest is a lot of fun A bit surprised that Disney couldnt flip this film for a good profit I get why John Carter and Lone Ranger failed those were just bad films But this This wasnt too bad it was a fun watch
2015-05-29 20:37:28,0,0,0,Tomorrowland,Okay but Tomorrowland wasnt good
2015-05-29 20:41:30,1,0,1,Tomorrowland,gt If Tomorrowland were any good it would do better at the box office
2015-05-29 20:42:49,1,0,1,Tomorrowland,Tomorrowland isnt even an original IPtechnically speaking Rather than being an adaptation of a book or comic its based off of a whole section of Disney WorldLand The section is the futuristic part of the park based off of concepts and ideas proposed by Walt Disney decades ago
2015-05-29 20:47:09,2,0,2,Tomorrowland,Saw Tomorrowland yesterday It was terrible They need to support original movies NOT written by Damon Lindelof The whole thing was a mess Boring non stop expository dialogue too abstract Sorry
2015-05-29 20:49:55,1,0,1,Tomorrowland,I dont give a crap if its a reboot sequel prequel or an original if its good Ill watch it Which is why I saw Mad Max and not Tomorrowland
2015-05-29 20:50:20,1,0,1,Tomorrowland,i watched tomorrowland The first half was pretty good When it got to the exposition in the end it fell apart I like the effort but the ending made no sense Still better than the transformers crap
2015-05-29 20:51:50,1,0,1,Tomorrowland,I dont think original movies are completely dying I just think that theyre dying in the sense of thats what is being heavily promoted I personally did enjoy Tomorrowland in the same way described in this article but I understand that people have different tastes I mean look back a couple months ago when Project Almanac was in theaters I could be wrong but Im sure that movie was a success Also if you really believe that movies are losing originality then look at TV because Netflix and others are seriously bringing in original content for their series like in Lillyhammer and Orange is the New Black Thats just my thoughts on the matter
2015-05-29 20:53:43,2,0,2,Tomorrowland,How is Tomorrowland considered original

2015-05-29 20:58:27,2,0,2,Tomorrowland,I really hate the idea that because we may want more original movies we should support shitty ones I havent seen Tomorrowland yet and expect Ill see it eventually but this suffered more from crappy advertising and buildup than anything The first trailer made it seem like a weird kids movie Id have no interest in It wasnt until just last week that I saw a trailer for it making it look like a scifi movie with action and anything interesting at all
2015-05-29 20:59:55,1,0,1,Tomorrowland,Tomorrowland was actually a good movie Perhaps you just didnt give it a chance
2015-05-29 21:06:07,1,0,1,Tomorrowland,The problem with this movie is the writing You have a perfect opportunity here to explore childlike joy and optimism to appeal to the audiences sense of wonder and to inspire them and you spend 2 hours and 20 minutes on bland action scenes and uninventive plot devices Everything important felt truncated it takes an hour and a half to get to tomorrowland but it takes about ten minutes to learn the problem find the source of it meet the villain and fix it
2015-05-29 21:14:04,2,0,2,Tomorrowland,Google the word trademark Ironically you dont seem to understand what a brand is Disney is a brand and under its umbrella there are innumerable other brands Tomorrowland is one of them
2015-05-29 21:14:15,1,0,1,Tomorrowland,TomorrowLand isnt a great film tho Simply being original isnt a reason to support something At least not by itself It has to actually be good too

2015-05-29 22:20:08,1,0,1,Tomorrowland,Just for perspective tomorrowland made 43mil in four days John Wick made 43mil over 91 days
2015-05-29 22:22:06,2,0,2,Tomorrowland,Ive never been to Disney and assumed it was a ride The point that movie sounds like an ad for Come to Disney and visit Tomorrowland doesnt really change if its a ride or a section of the park
2015-05-29 22:26:42,1,0,1,Tomorrowland,So why dont we like IPs I think the general consensus is we want to see something new and we want to be surprised Tomorrowland by all accounts despite its status as an IP didnt do this An IP I think is less likely to surprise If an original property is great or an IP is great than we will all be happy I think usually though there is some new bit of creativity to love in an original property that a formulaic franchise film might not have This is why we all clamor for more originality
2015-05-29 22:38:25,1,0,1,Tomorrowland,Heres the thing about Tomorrowland  its called TOMORROWLAND It seems cheesy thats all it is
2015-05-29 22:42:00,1,0,1,Tomorrowland,Tomorrowland is a giant pile of crap I regret spending money on it
2015-05-29 22:42:58,2,0,2,Tomorrowland,Ha Yeah that sentence definitely should refer to Tomorrowland and more broadly films like this Ill make that edit to clarify it
2015-05-29 22:48:29,1,0,1,Tomorrowland,The authors reasons for being optimistic about Tomorrowland is exactly what should be the drivers for original movies good director and cast interesting idea etc I dont think that any studio would be taking a chance on a movie like Tomorrowland because they know all the parts are there regardless of the plot You cant expect people and studios to blindly support original ideas in the hopes that they eventually get better
2015-05-29 22:51:30,1,0,1,Tomorrowland,F this noise There should be more original films But Tomorrowland has issues and problems
2015-05-29 22:52:16,4,0,4,Tomorrowland,How in gods name is Tomorrowland considered an original property its based off an attraction from Disneyland WTF this would be like claiming Battleship is original IP I cant think of a worse example to use
2015-05-29 22:52:32,1,0,1,Tomorrowland,gt If Tomorrowland were any good it would do better at the box office
2015-05-29 22:53:59,2,0,2,Tomorrowland,Mad Max did not feel any more or less original than Tomorrowland What it did feel like was a masterfully executed thrill ride which Tomorrowland did not
2015-05-29 23:05:18,0,0,0,Tomorrowland,I love how all the top comments say stuff along these lines but this contradicts the status quo here that original  good sequels  bad Hollywood needs more originality I know people throw the word circlejerk around here a lot but I think it perfectly explains whats happening now We have two colliding circlejerks in this thread the original  good one and the Tomorrowland  bad one The latter is overpowering the former If OPs post was exactly the same as it is now but Tomorrowland was replaced with Interstellar or Her or some other original scifi flick that is more popular here people would be agreeing with OPs posts with no qualifications whatsoever We would just be getting more original  good posts in the top comments not these comments with caveats well the original movies have to be good obviously
2015-05-29 23:16:41,2,0,2,Tomorrowland,Im not watching Tomorrowland because looney Clooney is in it I will do anything it takes to get Hillary elected I very much doubt Im alone
2015-05-29 23:26:09,3,0,3,Tomorrowland,This I mean Ill support original content all day Btu Tomorrowland didnt look any good Im not spending money on a movie that looks bad I dont care how original it is
2015-05-29 23:27:11,2,0,2,Tomorrowland,Its going to lose quite a bit of money its a bomb  Now Lone Ranger was a historic bomb while Tomorrowland is simply a run of the mill bomb
2015-05-29 23:27:43,1,0,1,Tomorrowland,How was tomorrowland original then according to the author
2015-05-29 23:39:49,1,0,1,Tomorrowland,tomorrowland looks dumb as hell
2015-05-29 23:43:38,1,0,1,Tomorrowland,I was Avengers 2 and Tomorrowland last weekend I had roughly equal expectations going in I thought the two movies were similar except that Avengers was clever and coherent and Tomorrowland was not Good characters writing and directing are inherently original in the same way that human beings are Tomorrowland was basically a straw man argument for having a positive attitude with some nifty CGI George Clooneys natural charisma didnt even register
2015-05-29 23:45:28,1,0,1,Tomorrowland,Edge of Tomorrowland
2015-05-29 23:46:15,1,0,1,Tomorrowland,I liked Tomorrowland It definitely had its flaws but I thought it was an enjoyable experience overall and after wave upon wave of dystopia movies I found it refreshing to see something with a sense of optimism
2015-05-30 00:03:06,0,0,0,Tomorrowland,I would love to see Hollywood make more original content But Studios are scared to invest in films that dont already have a builtin market Tomorrowland is one example of an original movie in a trend that has movie makers investors hesitating When these studios make a sequel to a popular franchise they know they are going to make a shitload of money They dont have that feeling of security with original film productions
2015-05-30 00:10:18,1,0,1,Tomorrowland,Tomorrowland wasnt a good movie  It had all sorts of problems  Nobody should be rallying around Tomorrowland
2015-05-30 00:25:21,1,0,1,Tomorrowland,Tomorrowland was good dont listen to the critics or rotten tomatoes for that one
2015-05-30 00:34:25,1,0,1,Tomorrowland,I honestly really like that and I fully understand what the guy is trying to say Good or bad original content is needed Theres plenty of truly good sequels Its just that if the only way to fix the originality problem is to both watch Tomorrowland and then not say anything about it then thats asking a bit too much
2015-05-30 00:41:04,2,0,2,Tomorrowland,gtDisney recently bet big on an original project called Tomorrowland which was inspired by the theme park attraction as well as the imagination and dreams of Walt Disney himself The movie was directed by Brad Bird from a script by Damon Lindelof
2015-05-30 01:01:21,1,0,1,Tomorrowland,Also Tomorrowland is an old Disney IP Thats like calling the first Pirate of the Caribbean and original movie because it had not been made into a film yet What a shit conception of what an original movie is
2015-05-30 01:13:21,2,0,2,Tomorrowland,If thats the case then the title The Land of Tomorrow said in a 1920s radio broadcast voice or even Disneys voice with the same visuals used in the trailer wouldve attracted me more than Tomorrowland That title just reminds me of all the other movies inspired by Disneyland rides
2015-05-30 01:25:05,1,0,1,Tomorrowland,I liked Tomorrowland
2015-05-30 01:27:26,1,0,1,Tomorrowland,Tomorrowland is based on a preexisting property its an original story sure but its using the name of an amusement park as brand recognition its as much of an original movie as The Lego Movie Battleship or What to Expect When Youre Expecting
2015-05-30 01:35:39,313,0,313,Tomorrowland,I blame Tomorrowland for this
2015-05-30 01:36:20,563,0,563,Tomorrowland,thanks tomorrowland
2015-05-30 01:42:36,40,0,40,Tomorrowland,My two favorite parts of Tron Legacy were the light cycle chase and Jeff Bridges and considering that Bridges characters kicked the bucket I wouldnt have much to look forward to With that said I enjoyed Tron Legacy way more than Avengers 2 or Tomorrowland
2015-05-30 01:51:12,16,0,16,Tomorrowland,gt Three of their last attempts Tomorrowland John Carter Mars Needs Moms have all been massive bombs
2015-05-30 01:52:04,-11,0,-11,Tomorrowland,Whats that have to do with tron Tomorrowland is an original film
2015-05-30 02:01:57,9,0,9,Tomorrowland,Hes referring to the fact Tomorrowland is pretty much bombing in the cinemas and the critics arent rating it great Disney were banking on Tomorrowland being a good film I guess they dont want to put a lot of money into a third Tron film and run the risk that it could go the same way as Tomorrowland
2015-05-30 02:04:03,82,0,82,Tomorrowland,Im really surprised that theyre not going forward with a 3rd Legacy undoubtably had flaws but its better than most people give it credit for especially considering that its a disney movie about people going into computers The special effects are superb and were highly praised and it was a solid box office success so its strange that theyre not going for another sequel Maybe disney was taken aback and perhaps a bit bitter by how poorly Tomorrowland did but thats only because they really didnt market it well
2015-05-30 02:05:11,102,0,102,Tomorrowland,Tomorrowland and John Carter I think wouldve done better if the marketing would be better Like I have no idea what either movie are about but I hear theyre good from people that seen it Mars Needs Moms Well yeah you got me there that movie just looked like crap
2015-05-30 02:10:07,18,0,18,Tomorrowland,As Battleship crippled GI Joe Tomorrowland killed Tron
2015-05-30 02:22:27,30,0,30,Tomorrowland,I doubt thats the reason considering the string of other live action Disney films that actually did bomb domestically The Lone Ranger and John Carter opened to even less Its too soon to say about Tomorrowland
2015-05-30 02:23:26,-1,0,-1,Tomorrowland,Tomorrowland only just opened in most international markets
2015-05-30 02:29:34,3,0,3,Tomorrowland,Bullshit If Disney stopped production of films for every film that bombed they wouldnt be making a shit ton of movies as they do now John Carter and The Lone Ranger were bombs and that didnt stop them Tomorrowland is still in its first week and it doesnt seem like its going to bomb that hard anyway
2015-05-30 02:30:37,24,0,24,Tomorrowland,I dont think Tomorrowland was that bad
2015-05-30 02:37:10,48,0,48,Tomorrowland,Tomorrowland was just meh to me The highlight of my experience was seeing the Episode 7 trailer in a theater
2015-05-30 02:49:21,95,0,95,Tomorrowland,Why is everyone saying that Its not like he wrote the screenplay by himself Brad Bird also worked on the script Its upsetting to see Brad Bird make a lessthanspectacular film but unfortunately every filmmaker has their stinkers Not that I consider Tomorrowland a stinker by any means but its definitely not up to Bird standards
2015-05-30 02:51:33,1,0,1,Tomorrowland,Why do you think Tomorrowland directly caused this decision Just being curious
2015-05-30 03:01:02,13,0,13,Tomorrowland,I have not seen Tomorrowland but I highly recommend Mad Max
2015-05-30 03:04:35,13,0,13,Tomorrowland,Loved the Carousel of Progress song making an appearance I dont care how dated that ride is I hope it is in Tomorrowland forever
2015-05-30 03:14:20,1,0,1,Tomorrowland,Whats wrong with Tomorrowland I havent seen it but the article said theres been a lot of hate for it
2015-05-30 03:29:37,1,0,1,Tomorrowland,Its a cut of a growing piece of the pie but still fairly small The most profitable markets are in Asia which require the heaviest translation Considering even Avengers Age of Ultron suffered from issues in the move over I just dont see Tomorrowland working well As said the last third of the movie is contingent upon a series of long monologues that explain the entire confusing premise Its a recipe for disaster
2015-05-30 03:32:12,51,0,51,Tomorrowland,I disagree with this thinking Tron 2 made 400 million worldwide with a budget of 176 million If anything Disney should be pushing this forward to make up for the crap performance of Tomorrowland Their reason of it doesnt fit in the schedule is just bullshit
2015-05-30 03:35:01,2,0,2,Tomorrowland,Duh Cant believe I mentally substituted Epcot and Tomorrowland while discussing Tomorrowland
2015-05-30 03:38:25,37,0,37,Tomorrowland,Why use TRON 3 which is relying on the same allages scifi audience that didnt show up for Tomorrowland to make up for that films failure when there are literally a dozen other projects sitting right in front of you that are safer bets Put another Marvel film on the schedule Remake another fairytale Spinoff another Star Wars character Expand the animation division
2015-05-30 03:53:07,3,0,3,Tomorrowland,Im not understanding Why is everyone saying Tomorrowland bombed It was number 1 at the box office this past weekend the reviews are decent at the very least 58 is still fresh last I checked and when I saw it I had a blast though thats probably the least important thing here
2015-05-30 04:05:18,3,0,3,Tomorrowland,Youre probably missing the part where Disney spent a whopping 190 million on Tomorrowland Thats more than many of the Marvel films and its opening weekend is a fraction of those movies The film isnt likely to have legs either Its the summer movie season Foreign sales will help a bit but Disneys previous live action films have already shown us that they can barely break even when marketing costs are factored in Tomorrowland just has many cards stacked against it
2015-05-30 04:07:30,1,0,1,Tomorrowland,Im just gonna go see Ex Machina again instead of checking out Tomorrowland
2015-05-30 04:08:59,-13,0,-13,Tomorrowland,Mad Max is just grunting and explosions See Tomorrowland if youd like to see something more original and substantive
2015-05-30 04:24:29,1,0,1,Tomorrowland,And Tomorrowland is in Magic Kingdom
2015-05-30 05:07:20,1,0,1,Tomorrowland,The question to me is why was the movie made I think it was made because people know the name Tomorrowland and thats just not a good reason in my opinion That makes me feel like Im being sold a product and brand first and a story second That just doesnt work for me
2015-05-30 05:10:01,1,0,1,Tomorrowland,Yeah its way too early to start pointing fingers towards Tomorrowland especially considering how its actually doing financially well at the Box Office
2015-05-30 05:19:32,1,0,1,Tomorrowland,Funny Critics seem to agree that Tomorrowland is full of clichs
2015-05-30 06:00:01,10,0,10,Tomorrowland,Why use an original conceptstory like Tomorrowland that appears to be failing and compare it to an already profitable franchise like Tron My point is why lose faith in a proven profit maker just because a first time concept failed They would be better off dropping some other original concept for fear of it failing too if it is all about money
2015-05-30 06:20:32,20,0,20,Tomorrowland,Lindelof really is terrible Look at how Lost ended Look at Star Trek into darkness and how the reveal of  was handled Look at Prometheus Tomorrowland same thing Lots of promise in the setup but he doesnt deliver They all have the same problem Weak plots with weak characters and with weak third acts that dont resolve the story in any way
2015-05-30 06:42:16,0,0,0,Tomorrowland,Here Ill sum up Tomorrowland for you   DREAMERS KEEP ON DREAMIN
2015-05-30 06:54:51,1,0,1,Tomorrowland,I thought this until all the casting stuff came out recently Something changed recently Im betting it was tomorrowland
2015-05-30 08:00:18,1,0,1,Tomorrowland,Ill go see this movie if someone can tell me its better than Tomorrowland Fuck Tomorrowland
2015-05-30 08:32:30,3,0,3,Tomorrowland,Duuuuude Who cares that Tomorrowland sucked I want Tron 3
2015-05-30 09:04:04,15,0,15,Tomorrowland,In that case Fuck you Tomorrowland
2015-05-30 09:54:19,8,0,8,Tomorrowland,This pretty much sums it up for me I was exceedingly excited for Tomorrowland about 2 months ago I dont know what changed but now Im just not anymore It may be that my excitement was ruined after how good Mad Max was
2015-05-30 10:12:30,1,0,1,Tomorrowland,Tomorrowland was likely a move to court Brad Bird as he has now committed to make The Incredibles sequel which is likely to make approximately a mountain of money
2015-05-30 10:29:04,1,0,1,Tomorrowland,I saw Tomorrowland The movie was meh I would certainly never pay to watch it at home and I suggest you never either watching it for free when it comes on cable is the only way you should watch it You go into the movie thinking that its a kid movie and for the most part it is but then they start actually killing like 3 people no main characters
2015-05-30 11:39:45,1,0,1,Tomorrowland,The only reason I saw Tomorrowland because I was with a group of noisy loud and immature friends so they wouldve spoiled Mad Max for me Btw Tomorrowland turned out to be good Still go see Mad Max OP
2015-05-30 12:04:18,2,0,2,Tomorrowland,Why are people blaming Tomorrowland
2015-05-30 13:02:33,16,0,16,Tomorrowland,Oh which of World War Z Prometheus Cowboys amp Aliens or Tomorrowland would you call examples of acclaim worthy writing And you talk as if those awards are in any way meaningful which is kind of funny
2015-05-30 13:26:11,1,0,1,Tomorrowland,Tomorrowland was a bomb Well thats a shame I saw it today and loved it to bits It had its flaws and got a little muddled along the way but it was very magical to me
2015-05-30 13:38:10,7,0,7,Tomorrowland,I think you also have to consider the content of the shot I havent seen  Tomorrowland yet but in AoU I certainly noticed the long shot It was kind of cool but at the same time I didnt care that much The problem is it was such a busy shot its hard to imagine that it was even difficult to cut it together The shot at the beginning of Touch of Evil for example is so intricate that its incredible to watch It took them all night to film it Not to edit it just to FILM it These shots dont require the same effort by actors and directors now its more of an effort by the editing teams and therefore it goes more unnoticed which is unfortunate but its a fact The ones listed also didnt necessarily contain content that I would care that it is contained in one shot The shot in Goodfellas for example is amazing because youre really seeing the way he operates and the process of pleasing these gangsters from the time they walk into the door to when they sit down Its not impressive simply to shoot one long shot it has to be content that is impressive to view as one shot
2015-05-30 13:54:39,1,0,1,Tomorrowland,sort of technically both pirates and tomorrowland were disney films from preexisting IP but those werent initially retreds Tomorrowland especially doesnt do much with that as a limitation make tomorrowland have a different name and it is an original IP
2015-05-30 14:44:16,7,0,7,Tomorrowland,I had no idea who this guy was so I looked up his screenwriting credits on IMDB Cowboys amp aliens prometheus world war z tomorrowland avatar the last airbenderI think were pretty safe in assuming he sucks at his job
2015-05-30 14:57:27,1,0,1,Tomorrowland,I like originality in movie Edge of tomorrow is a great example Tomorrowland is just not really good It was such a sad thing to happen because they wasted a great opening
2015-05-30 15:07:58,8,0,8,Tomorrowland,This is a shame Ive heard great things about Tomorrowland and Im planning on seeing it on Monday
2015-05-30 15:08:28,0,0,0,Tomorrowland,Apparently theyve also started considering upping their park pricesholy shit they were really banking on Tomorrowland and holy fuck its just not worked for them whatsoever
2015-05-30 15:13:49,5,0,5,Tomorrowland,Id only seen the teaser for Tomorrowland before I saw it yesterday I had no idea what was going to happen or what people thought of it I loved it While it definitely isnt perfect theres so much good stuff in it and IMO its been really overcriticised
2015-05-30 15:25:28,2,0,2,Tomorrowland,Uh no its not a coincidence  Studio executives follow the box office numbers religiously as if they were an exact measure of what the public wants right now  Im certain that the film execs see them both as scifi films and that Tomorrowland failing to meet expectations means that in their eyes audiences wont come out for another one since Tron Legacy also was not nearly a big a hit as Disney was hoping which makes it a very risky franchise in their eyes
2015-05-30 15:47:41,1,0,1,Tomorrowland,This is the problem though people would have complained that the trailers showed too much and spoiled all of the movie I get that marketing plays a role but I actually think Tomorrowland was marketed pretty well I was drawn in by the mystery aspect of not knowing much about the plot beforehand it made me more interested in the film It just turns out that the movie itself was a bit of a letdown but Tomorrowland
2015-05-30 16:11:39,3,0,3,Tomorrowland,What does Tomorrowland have to do with the Tron franchise
2015-05-30 17:17:13,2,0,2,Tomorrowland,Id see it again in theaters if theyd rerelease it but not sure how many people would be game  Its in my top 10 movies though  Just wish we could get more of that world  It would be a perfect addition to Disney World Tomorrowland section which is probably why its not happening
2015-05-30 17:34:26,2,0,2,Tomorrowland,After all the secrecy and hype Tomorrowland was a let down It felt like a very rough draft of a movie Tomorrowland itself wasnt even really explored which is baffling All the talk about it being this futuristic utopia and they barely showed the world the movie is titled after What the hell
2015-05-30 17:44:15,5,0,5,Tomorrowland,Seriously I didnt even know Tomorrowland was a movie until yesterday And I still havent a clue what its actually about
2015-05-30 18:08:45,3,0,3,Tomorrowland,Brad Bird only worked on Tomorrowland out of what you listed
2015-05-30 18:16:28,1,0,1,Tomorrowland,I fucking loved Tomorrowland Big time
2015-05-30 18:20:03,1,0,1,Tomorrowland,Not really Disney almost suffered losses with Tron Legacy and considering that Tomorrowland will most definitely be in the red hardly From what I know Tron 2 had a budget of around 170 million and marketing spent was I read it somewhere cant think where it was but if youre interested I can link it later about 170 million so 400 million in the bank minus the production and marketing budget  roughly 60 million now take from that what goes to each respective side and youll get to a pretty low income figure for Disney So yeah No petition not unless whole friggin China signed it will make Disney do a complete turnaround when it comes to Tron 3
2015-05-30 18:36:40,2,0,2,Tomorrowland,Youre joking right Tomorrowland is Brad Birds vision Damon Lindelof was just a hired hand to help flesh out a script I have complete confidence that Damon could write an amazing script if he stopped working on other peoples projects and made his own original script
2015-05-30 19:28:02,1,0,1,Tomorrowland,tomorrowland doesnt have enough shiny chrome
2015-05-30 19:45:34,26,0,26,Tomorrowland,People said the same about Tomorrowland because of Brad Bird
2015-05-30 20:08:35,10,0,10,Tomorrowland,Pretty much every Big Pixar Director has had at least one eh film Lasseter had Cars 2 Stanton had John Carter and Bird had Tomorrowland Doctor is the only one that has yet to make a nongreat film
2015-05-30 21:56:10,2,0,2,Tomorrowland,After actually reading many of the reviews I dont think Tomorrowland is the kind of 49 on RT movie that has that rating because its not that great but because its truly polarizing Some people think its a very thoughtful amazing movies and others think its corporate bullshit but there are few people giving it a 49 kind of rating
2015-05-30 22:18:42,1,0,1,Tomorrowland,I didnt know anything about tomorrowland until they showed the opening scene before the Avengers premiere and it actually seemed pretty decent from that if the rest of the film could keep that tempo and mood
2015-05-30 22:32:25,1,0,1,Tomorrowland,I find it interesting how Tomorrowland when from 1st to 4th I think with meddling reviews and competition for the next few weeks it will be a rough total gross
2015-05-30 23:04:30,1,0,1,Tomorrowland,Guy seriously loses any geek cred by making Tomorrowland his central focus and not Ex Machina
2015-05-31 00:49:19,5,0,5,Tomorrowland,Exactly Brad Bird still has an incredible track record even with Tomorrowland
2015-05-31 01:48:19,6,0,6,Tomorrowland,Fun fact  Tomorrowland is his first work under 94  on RT
2015-05-31 04:59:06,1,0,1,Tomorrowland,gtStanton had John Carter and Bird had Tomorrowland
2015-05-31 05:49:42,2,0,2,Tomorrowland,So because a completely unrelated film does badly they cancel one that has the potential to make a huge profit I saw tomorrowland and I actually didnt think it was that bad
2015-05-31 07:36:35,1,0,1,Tomorrowland,Its so they could advertise the film in Disneyland while everyones in Tomorrowland
2015-05-31 08:10:33,2,0,2,Tomorrowland,Fuck Tomorrowland this was better How are you going to make a movie called Tomorrowland put pictures of it on the damn poster and not even set the movie in Tomorrowland Assholes
2015-05-31 09:50:48,1,0,1,Tomorrowland,Really I thought Tomorrowland trailers showed too much The original teaser trailer was enough to show you the tone and the basic concept Brad bird directed it I dont think people should know more
2015-05-31 17:21:19,2,0,2,Tomorrowland,I did see Legacy Its why Im mad they canceled 3 So much wasted potential because they got cold feet due to Tomorrowland
2015-05-31 17:48:19,-5,0,-5,Tomorrowland,Well the Tomorrowland trailer had plenty of wonder look how that turned out I guess my point is trailers are tool directed at a mass market They are not really a great way to judge a film Sometimes its kind of obvious but in general judging a film based on its marketing is like judging Doritos based on its TV spots The whole purpose of marketing is to hit the broadest spectrum possible They already know that most of the diehards will go they need to show the dummies something that will actually make them understand what the film is I would have loved a mysterious of theme based trailer but what we get these days is heres our new killer dino look at it run and bite Then the dummies will go ohhh Ill go to that
2015-05-31 18:43:55,6,0,6,Tomorrowland,Tomorrowland
2015-05-31 18:50:33,1,0,1,Tomorrowland,gt they got cold feet due to Tomorrowland
2015-05-31 20:22:06,3,0,3,Tomorrowland,No Disney literally canned Tron 3 like two or three days ago Its not happening not anytime soon anyways Its assumed the poor reception from Tomorrowland is what killed it
2015-05-31 22:21:22,1,0,1,Tomorrowland,The ending is really really sad mostly just because its over and I really want to go to tomorrowland
2015-05-31 23:43:45,1,0,1,Tomorrowland,Did you even watch tomorrowland Its pretty good in my opinion and so was the incredibles Ratatouille was just ok in my book
2015-05-02 14:46:48,49,0,49,Cinderella,Should the Grimm Brothers still own the rights to Snow White Cinderella etc

2015-05-02 15:15:34,19,0,19,Cinderella,They own the rights to their versions Anyone can go make a Cinderella movie or their own Pinocchio film I have made my own version of a Cinderella film and Disney didnt come knocking on my door Youre fine as long as you dont use anything they created specifically for their version

2015-05-02 15:31:05,4,0,4,Cinderella,Thats not true at all They own the rights to their versions of it not to the story themselves There have been dozens of Cinderella movies since Disney did theirs and Pocahontas is a real person who cant be copyrighted Nothing you said is accurate in the slightest
2015-05-02 15:32:23,4,0,4,Cinderella,OK imagine no Shakespeare plays since he was recycling existing narratives that you would like to see placed under indefinite copyright No jazz standards No sampling None of the operas youve heard of would exist either None of the 3000000 modern retellings of Cinderella or Faust or A Christmas Carol etc
2015-05-02 15:36:45,43,0,43,Cinderella,You mean like Disney did with Cinderella beauty and the beast etc None of those were originally Disneys ideas
2015-05-02 15:43:47,8,0,8,Cinderella,Disney holds the copyright to Snow White that looks like thishttpimg3wikianocookienet__cb20141203223034disneyimagesee6Snow_Whitepng and Cinderella that looks like thishttpthefeministwirecomwpcontentuploads201403Cinderellajpg and on their own interpretation of their stories But as the literal characters predate Disney and are based on folk tales and other old stories Disney cannot prevent others from doing movies about Snow White or Cinderella Disney has managed to trademark the name Snow White unfortunately but Disney did not manage to trademark Cinderella as Cinderella is seen such a known cultural character whereas Snow White apparently is seen to be famous because of the original Disney film with people associating it much more to Disney products than Cinderella
2015-05-02 15:45:54,1,0,1,Cinderella,Grimm Brothers didnt build an empire from their characters If they had a themepark going at the time Disney wanted to make Cinderella Id support you And by your 25 year logic youd support that too
2015-05-02 15:54:31,2,0,2,Cinderella,Were only really talkin about characters here ones that are still used to fuel an industry Disney built the popularity of Snow White Cinderella Aladdin etc Sure Grimms Fairy Tales exist but 90 of you wouldnt even know of them without Disney Want proof  does The Miller Boy and the Cat ring any bells No
2015-05-02 15:56:16,3,0,3,Cinderella,Cinderella wasnt copyrighted because it was old The copyrights expired Or maybe there wasnt such a thing in the time of the brothers Grimm if there were it would have expired anyways So too should Disneys creations but they dont want to pay that debt Theyd rather pay politicians to pass laws
2015-05-02 15:58:34,9,0,9,Cinderella,So did Disney own Cinderella or Pinocchio or snow white before creating films with the characters thus using them for their profit
2015-05-02 16:04:41,17,0,17,Cinderella,So Disney should give back all the money theyve ever made on Cinderella

2015-05-02 16:35:20,6,0,6,Cinderella,What Panthers_fan is saying is that its wrong for anyone to make money off of Cinderella because of the fact that it wasnt their original idea
2015-05-02 16:51:02,19,0,19,Cinderella,As long as they only base it on the fairytale But our culture now associates fairy godmothers and magical transformations with Cinderella so other artists or filmmakers may want to use those elements but cant My point was that Disney built off of a story that wasnt theirs so why should others not be able to build off the Disney version
2015-05-02 16:55:53,1,0,1,Cinderella,How many Snow White films have you ever seen  How many Cinderella Where is this flood of public domain ripoff crap movies
2015-05-02 17:02:46,1,0,1,Cinderella,Snow White and the Huntsman did pretty well Theres been several non Disney movies of Cinderella and there was a film not long ago that went DirecttoDVD that featured Snow White Cinderella and Aladdin working together
2015-05-02 17:02:48,5,0,5,Cinderella,Haha what You honestly think that Disney has no right to make money from Cinderella Sleeping Beauty Beauty and the Beast The Lion King The Little Mermaid Hercules The Hunchback of Notre Dame etc Purely because those movies are based on earlier stories Do you even fucking know how story telling works
2015-05-02 17:15:29,5,0,5,Cinderella,I agree you just make it seem like they own Cinderella and other fairy tales and thats not true
2015-05-02 17:40:48,1,0,1,Cinderella,gtBut its 100 valid for Mickey Mouse Cinderella and other characters which are being used which people were complaining about Theres a major difference between using a character that will never be used again and using a character thats still being produced
2015-05-02 18:05:23,0,0,0,Cinderella,You should care because if they entered into the public domain we would be able to iterate on them If Hamlet or the folk tale about Cinderella never entered the public domain then wed have no Lion King or Disney Cinderella Even if you dont respect copyright law and its far from clear that we should given how warped its become you should still see the value in fixing it
2015-05-02 19:14:16,1,0,1,Cinderella,Right but the law is different Robin Hood doesnt belong to anybody because its a folk tale Cinderella and Sleeping Beauty do have original authors but they were written before copyright
2015-05-02 19:28:36,1,0,1,Cinderella,Why cant they reap the benefits of the ideas even if a movie is copyrighted Why cant someone build off the core concept of say Cinderella Copyright doesnt protect ideas You are going to need to drill down and be a bit more specific as to what the problem is
2015-05-02 20:02:06,1,0,1,Cinderella,Except they changed enough to make them different Eg Cinderella cant have a blue dress because it was described as green in the book You could have red or orange but not blue
2015-05-02 20:11:30,0,0,0,Cinderella,1 Take only the parts from Cinderella No scratch that take all the parts from Cinderella but still theyre just parts not like were taking the whole Cinderella right

2015-05-02 22:48:12,2,0,2,Cinderella,You literally are retarded As long as part 1 doesnt equal Literally tracing Disneys workdialog then the final put together part will not be the same as Disneys Cinderella meaning part 3 and therefore part 4 will not happen
2015-05-02 23:31:02,3,0,3,Cinderella,Because at some point the creator has been dead for 70 years and their estate has had ample time to benefit from exclusive rights Then others can use the content to create derivative works It becomes part of our collective culture If the original Italian author of Cinderella had unlimited exclusive rights to the story and the characters it couldnt have been used for Walt Disneys adaptation without permission Similarly the character of Mickey Mouse should enter the public domain someday Its a compromise that weve made for the good of society
2015-05-03 03:41:21,2,0,2,Cinderella,First off if you look at it that way Cinderella isnt a Disney story it was in the public domain first  I know youd say they didnt just copy something in the public domain they had their own twist on it they took a general story and turned it into something specific
2015-05-03 05:35:24,1,0,1,Cinderella,Thats exactly what Disney did with things like Cinderella You are only copyrighting the new version so you can technically go to the original sources Disney used and make your own movie Disney would try to sue you claiming its a rip off of their version but you can fight it

2015-05-08 19:11:01,5,0,5,Cinderella,I liked Cinderella but I thought Maleficent and Alive in Wonderland tried way too hard to be action movies
2015-05-09 00:04:25,1,0,1,Cinderella,Ive seen two out of the three that were already made Maleficent and Cinderella  Neither was particularly good but they werent god awful either  Cinderella was the better of the two imo
2015-05-09 06:44:33,1,0,1,Cinderella,Lost is explained the island is magic ergo your in Cinderella territory and you can just say the island did it
2015-05-09 06:59:31,1,0,1,Cinderella,I disagree about the Butterfly Effect The whole movie made its own rules about how alternate timelines interact Its like the Cinderella example who can say what the magic rules are
2015-05-09 07:08:26,1,0,1,Cinderella,To touch on the Cinderella reference you made the entire Cinderella story is based on the fact that the Prince would find Cinderella because the shoe would fit her foot perfectly
2015-05-09 07:08:31,7,0,7,Cinderella,Is it explicitly stated in Butterfly Effect that one small change in the past instantly alters the future If thats the case then Id say the scars are a plot hole while Cinderellas shoe isnt
2015-05-09 07:44:41,1,0,1,Cinderella,Pretty much yeah Butterfly Effect may or may bot have established how time travel works From the reply to your comment it probably did Cinderella couldve established how magic works It probably didnt
2015-05-09 08:27:03,2,0,2,Cinderella,Cinderellas slippers didnt turn back because they werent normal objects which were enchanted they were the real thing Its a gift the fairy godmother gives Cinderella while all other things were transformed from stuff Cinderella already had
2015-05-09 12:08:19,1,0,1,Cinderella,I remember answering the Cinderellas shoe thing my first day on reddit like 25 years ago  The fairy godmother pulls the shoes out of her pocketthey arent magic at all  The fairy godmother obviously knew all along what would happen and arranged it just so
2015-05-09 13:15:22,1,0,1,Cinderella,He was still wrong about the Cinderella shoe They established before the ball that at the moment the clock strikes twelve everything would revert to the way it was before This sets up clear rules to the magic of the story universe rule which are then violated by the shoes remaining Saying but magic is a ridiculous dodge when the magic is given clearly defined rules
2015-05-09 13:18:30,4,0,4,Cinderella,The Cinderella shoe thing is 100 a plot hole Its governed by magic What The spell was cast on her and not the shoe If I remember correctly all her clothes and the mice and pumpkin revert back The shoes should as well
2015-05-09 13:37:55,1,0,1,Cinderella,One thing I think you need to reevaluate is Cinderellas shoe and other magic or science fiction etc related plot holes It should change at Midnight given the Magic A Is Magic AhttptvtropesorgpmwikipmwikiphpMainMagicAIsMagicA rules of internally consistent in universe laws Her shoe should have changed given the rules set forth in the story To go against those rules causes a plot hole You cant just say wellllll who knows how it works Its magic
2015-05-09 14:02:18,1,0,1,Cinderella,Your Cinderella Its not a plot hole its magic explanation conflicts with your Butterfly Effect Its a plot hole explanation Theres no science behind time travel in Butterfly Effect The rules are never clearly laid out So the science of time travel in Butterfly effect is parallel to the magic of Cinderella Maybe in the Butterfly Effect time travel small events only create ripples through time not significant to alter a persons perception
2015-05-09 22:04:20,2,0,2,Cinderella,Im just going by the animated Disney version here but IIRC the Fairy Godmother makes the glass slippers suddenly appear on Cinderellas feet whereas the rest of her accoutrements were transformed from preexisting objectsanimals So the shoes wouldnt revert back to anything theyre permanent
2015-05-10 01:33:11,1,0,1,Cinderella,Just to clarify Disney used quite a bit of rotoscoping AFTER  Snow White  Its in a bunch of films like Cinderella You can see a lot of it in things like the wagon in Pinocchio or the car in 101 Dalmations
2015-05-10 16:27:52,35,0,35,Cinderella,If you havent yet you should actually check out Cinderella It exceeded all my expectations and was actually pretty good It was directed by Kenneth Branagh who also directed Hamlet and Thor It also is certifiably fresh on Rotten Tomatoes with a score of 85100
2015-05-10 17:18:28,-3,0,-3,Cinderella,Yeah its true Disney owns our asses when it comes to entertainment I dont like the reimaginings because they just rehash the same story Thats limiting already AND there is a very fine line between just telling the story again and addingchanging stuff so its easy to piss people off But on the other hand Disney has never really tried with their liveactionlike ever They do just enough for it to be good and go on to the next Disney films are an animation company first then live action I hated the Alice in Wonderlandstill havent finished it Oz wasnt all that great besides that 3D waterfallMaleficent was just blahand Cinderella was surprising very damn good And its also the lowest grossing of the 4 I mentioned You would think its Cinderella One the staples of Disney magic and childhood memories but oh well
2015-05-10 20:44:27,1,0,1,Cinderella,After reading your criticisms I can say that I agree with you and I saw Cinderella and found it boring

2015-05-06 05:09:08,-3,0,-3,Entourage,such a bad ending i wish HBO had some balls and did something interesting with the last season like having Vinnie die and follow how the entourage cope without him
2015-05-08 02:43:06,11,0,11,Entourage,Having an entourage is expensive
2015-05-09 13:42:52,43,0,43,Entourage,Neil Patrick Harris in the Harold and Kumar movies Or Entourage

2015-05-11 14:42:10,-4,0,-4,Entourage,Sonits time you learned something Entourage was always terrible Its just you whove grown up
2015-05-11 14:46:26,1,0,1,Entourage,There are levels of money grabbing Entourage had almost 100 episodes to tell whatever story they were trying to tell Getting the gang back together for this movie  is not going to serve any real story purpose its ultimately because the creators and stars saw dollar signs
2015-05-11 15:31:38,1,0,1,Entourage,Again Ill agree that most films are attempts to make money to some degree or another But there is a spectrum and Entourage is waaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaay over on the side of LETS MAKE SOME CASH And that can tell you something about the amount of effortlove actually put into the project
2015-05-11 15:42:31,2,0,2,Entourage,Its the same reason I enjoy Entourage
2015-05-11 16:05:39,2,0,2,Entourage,It has granted Entourage was the perfect shameless entertainment  Not everything that entertains has to be of the upmost quality
2015-05-11 16:53:29,1,0,1,Entourage,You clearly didnt really enjoy watching entourage because if you did you wouldnt say such rubbish go save your money and get yourself a foot long subway instead
2015-05-11 18:31:36,7,0,7,Entourage,You are forgetting about Sorpranos True Blood True Detective Boardwalk Empire Entourage Sex and the City etc Game of Thrones is just one success story out of many for HBO Lets not trivialize what HBO has done for the history of television by making The Sopranos They started a trend by having uncensored shows To say that HBO shows are not wildly popular and base it all on Game of Thrones is very ignorant
2015-05-13 18:48:30,-1,0,-1,Entourage,Entourage is the way I found out about Pablo Escobar Anytime they talk about movies about him I immediately think of the shot of Vinny Chase spinning in a circle staring up at the camera I cant take these movies serious cause of that
2015-05-14 20:56:05,1,0,1,Entourage,So youre saying youre not getting spun up for the Entourage movie at this point P
2015-05-15 06:17:13,8,0,8,Entourage,We dont need a remake Were need a sequel to the eighties one with Kevin Dillon Outside of entourage that dudes got nothing better to do

2015-05-16 20:05:16,0,0,0,Entourage,You dont know a thing about box office if you think this movie is gonna hold at 40 mil a week for a month In that timeframe there will be two huge summer vehicles one for The Rock and one for Clooney you have some horror movies for the first time in a while Melissa McCarthy has a movie a Bradley CooperEmma Stone rom com with an excellent cast and fucking Entourage
2015-05-18 08:14:25,2,0,2,Entourage,I dont know if youre also asking this but the trailers I saw before the movie were Spy Entourage Crimson Peak and I dont remember what else I was too mesmerized by the movie itself
2015-05-18 12:59:30,3,0,3,Entourage,Take away Sinister 2 and Entourage Add The Transporter Refueled and San Andreas
2015-05-18 18:40:30,1,0,1,Entourage,Sinister 2 The Gift Jurassic World San Andreas some M Night Shyamalan movie Fantastic 4 The Walk Entourage and I think I missed one or two I just remember there being a ridiculous amount
2015-05-18 20:11:09,-4,0,-4,Entourage,Cheating a bit because the movie isnt out yet but Vincent Chase Johnny Drama E and Turtle for Entourage
2015-05-18 21:57:14,1,0,1,Entourage,Jurassic World Vacation Entourage Sinister 2 Southpaw Fantastic Four and The Gift were the trailers that played during my showing
2015-05-19 17:36:20,34,0,34,Entourage,I thought that was Entourage
2015-05-19 19:53:41,4,0,4,Entourage,Eh no Entourage is pretty good I hope the movie isnt packed with douchbags
2015-05-20 01:58:01,4,0,4,Entourage,Hes in the Entourage film Saw him in the trailer
2015-05-20 03:16:32,2,0,2,Entourage,Shes also in the entourage movie
2015-05-20 05:24:38,0,0,0,Entourage,gt Also getting caught up on Entourage for the movie though I find it odd that these dudes Piven excluded are hardly in any movies
2015-05-20 16:30:22,2,0,2,Entourage,This may last a while especially if Entourage flops
2015-05-20 17:28:58,1,0,1,Entourage,Nothing like Entourage At all A bit like Downton Abbey
2015-05-20 22:30:15,3,0,3,Entourage,Spielberg did help conceive many of the famous action set pieces going back to the original trilogy He was in Lucass entourage just like how JJ Abrams works with his same band of uncredited writers under Bad Robot
2015-05-21 04:25:28,25,0,25,Entourage,Just finished viewing it as well  Was extremely happy thst the movie kept the entourage feel  Piven was perfect as Gold again and the movie definitely had its moments Overall Id say if you enjoyed the show the movie will be lots of fun for you
2015-05-21 06:22:26,1,0,1,Entourage,Entourage
2015-05-21 08:05:29,3,0,3,Entourage,Well if youre a movie person youll like Entourage Its pretty much an extensive behind the scenes look at a young actors career
2015-05-21 11:23:03,17,0,17,Entourage,Entourage is sex in the city for guys but it was fun
2015-05-21 12:11:31,0,0,0,Entourage,ehh its cool to hate on Entourage lately
2015-05-21 12:40:54,1,0,1,Entourage,One thing that bothered me about Entourage is that things worked out way too well for those guys in the end so Ive got to ask does this movie end on another all time high note
2015-05-21 14:45:35,-6,0,-6,Entourage,It had more depth than Sex in the City  Sex in the City was just girls being girls  Entourage was boys being boys PLUS interesting commentary on Hollywood and dynamics of the acting industry
2015-05-21 15:28:29,1,0,1,Entourage,Last Week Tonight shredded it this past week Its definitely cool to hate Entourage
2015-05-21 18:59:27,2,0,2,Entourage,THERE IS NO ENTOURAGE 2
2015-05-21 22:48:46,6,0,6,Entourage,Sex and the City and Entourage
2015-05-24 02:08:32,1,0,1,Entourage,Ive never been into Entourage but I will still catch the film and maybe catch up on the show afterwards Jurassic World looked great in the beginning but Im starting to lose faith a bit AntMan looks interesting Im sure a joke will be added in Civil War about AntMan and Ultron Fantastic Four looks okI loved Chronicle but FFs production went through hell and i dont think Trank was ready for it But thats just from rumors so idc about the production problems as much Im down for the diversity but nothing is really screaming out to me about it AND HAAAAAAAA Yeah I believe there is something popular releasing on December 18 Damn whats that darn title again
2015-05-24 02:08:41,0,0,0,Entourage,Im not sure Id like to say its highconcept because the plot is simple the plot is the same as the title and the entourage of different characters are the type that anyone can identify in hisher own life I think because the movie isnt as much concerned with subtlety as it is with the big picture of growing up it would be highconcept
2015-05-24 19:20:13,4,0,4,Entourage,Old man hat a few years ago it was only comic movies and other stuff with a strong following that had a midnightThursday lineup Its the norm now and you can see like Entourage at midnight but kickass would have been prime fodder for that then
2015-05-25 20:42:36,5,0,5,Entourage,I saw an Advanced Screening last week If you are a fan of the series you will like it as I did Its not a perfect movie but is a very fun return of the characters with a solid story great cameos and the return of my favorite part of Entourage the behind the scenes of making movies I loved seasons 15 and the rest were alright mainly for the characters But go see the movie Its good
2015-05-26 00:19:57,2,0,2,Entourage,The role is still a rather comedic one she lightens up some of the scenes with the mostly dry NASA folks Reminded me of the publicist from Entourage
2015-05-26 18:03:51,1,0,1,Entourage,Entourage Does anyone even care about it anymore The finale had 31 million viewers Thats a pretty small number of people who would care about the movie Even if thay all went to see it thats what 45 million And it has a near zero internationsl appeal Sure there were probably lots of people who pirated it but theyd probably just pirate the movie too especially since it doesnt lend itself to doling out the bucks to see it on the big screen
2015-05-26 19:55:40,1,0,1,Entourage,I cant wait until the remake of the Entourage movie You know to go with the trend
2015-05-26 20:05:31,2,0,2,Entourage,Me and a few friends love Entourage I even own the entire series on DVD I didnt have HBO back then and none of us want to go to the theater to pay to watch this lol This was a horrible idea should have just been on HBO if they really wanted to do it Ill catch it on redbox or Netflix
2015-05-26 21:22:21,1,0,1,Entourage,For real Im pretty excited about it It will just be a 4x long Entourage episode which I think will be cool
2015-05-26 22:10:38,1,0,1,Entourage,This looks like a fake movie that would get made in Entourage or something
2015-05-27 14:50:47,1,0,1,Entourage,So its the dudes from Entourage
2015-05-28 00:24:46,1,0,1,Entourage,Gotta love Entourage
2015-05-28 14:16:29,1,0,1,Entourage,Sunset boulevard  any relation to the one Vincent Chase makes in entourage
2015-05-28 19:23:56,2,0,2,Entourage,Haha dammit I love Entourage Very excited for the movie Vinny is gonna kill it
2015-05-29 23:41:18,3,0,3,Entourage,I think he was the only supporting character in Entourage that turned out to be a genuinely good guy
2015-05-30 16:01:54,18,0,18,Entourage,I think San Andreas might have some legs theres no other action competitors coming out until Jurassic World and I dont think the Entourage movie is going to shake up the box office Poor word of mouth could make it dip big time but The Rock is pretty dependable box office wise
2015-05-30 17:00:31,13,0,13,Entourage,Its an Entourage reference
2015-05-30 18:58:21,2,0,2,Entourage,Entourage is rated R there are going to be boobies galore
2015-05-31 00:27:03,3,0,3,Entourage,never watch EntourageSo missed the reference
2015-05-31 00:47:21,5,0,5,Entourage,Came here looking for an Entourage reference Was not disappointed
2015-05-31 10:15:53,-4,0,-4,Entourage,I thought In Bruges was brilliant yet no one in my entourage seems to have even heard of ityet  I also enjoyed Seven Psychopaths although to a lesser extent Still good though but not very popular

2015-05-21 12:58:26,8,0,8,The Apu Trilogy,Seeing this next weekend So excited The Apu Trilogy is just incredible
2015-05-28 01:58:08,15,0,15,The Apu Trilogy,The Apu Trilogy Follows the life of a young Indian boy from a little kid to adulthood Incredibly beautiful tragic and so well made The films just recently got restored too so hopefully more will discover this incredible series
2015-05-28 06:42:31,5,0,5,The Apu Trilogy,Since someone already mentioned The Apu Trilogy Ill chime in with The Human ConditionhttpenwikipediaorgwikiThe_Human_Condition_film_series trilogy by Masaki Kobayashi
2015-05-30 09:19:41,3,0,3,The Apu Trilogy,The Apu trilogy is just stunning Like italian neorealism but with more magic But Satyajit Ray is the only famous Indian director I know of Are the more I definitely want to check out more Indian movies
2015-05-30 21:04:03,1,0,1,The Apu Trilogy,Had to scroll way too far for Charulata and the Apu trilogy
2015-05-24 11:41:34,1,0,1,Tanu Weds Manu Returns,Tanu Weds Manu Returns starring Kangana Ranaut and R Madhavan directed by Anand L Rai has made a Striking start at the box office The film on its first day is the third highest collection in 2015 Tanu Weds Manu Returns are way higher than the original one on the first day
2015-05-29 12:04:27,2,0,2,Tanu Weds Manu Returns,Itd be cool if we could have headlines that make sense virtually no one on this sub will recognize that Tanu Weds Manu Returns is a movie
2015-05-01 10:19:35,8,0,8,The Imitation Game,The Imitation Game By the numbers biopic that isnt really all that accurate Great but not incrediblemust see acting and directing Other biopics that have been released in the past ten years Lincoln 12 Years a Slave Walk the Line Hunger La Vie en Rose The Social Network I dont think The Imitation Game will hold up all that well comparatively
2015-05-01 13:32:28,4,0,4,The Imitation Game,The Imitation Game will age well I mean I dont feel it has any particular style that can be looked at as cheesy or old school in the future Its pretty soulless to be honest
2015-05-01 17:28:38,6,0,6,The Imitation Game,The Imitation Game
2015-05-02 12:13:15,4,0,4,The Imitation Game,Ooh youre right I just spent the last hour reading about the imitation game
2015-05-03 18:01:50,9,0,9,The Imitation Game,The Imitation Game wins this by default since it was the only film I saw this week but I really liked it nonetheless Cumberbatch was great in his role as was Keira and the movie was really well shot and paced it really flew by for the most part I also never knew about Turings story and his contribution in todays society so I appreciate this movie even more for that
2015-05-04 19:08:20,0,0,0,The Imitation Game,I didnt see the appeal either Of the best pictures noms this one and the Imitation Game I left til last My feeling Sigh typical Oscar movie youll see everything coming It is actually great but perhaps not rewatchable great Its basically a love story At least thats how I viewed it I doubt you would regret it and afterwards youll praise Redmayne like everyone else
2015-05-05 13:03:21,1,0,1,The Imitation Game,The imitation game I never understood before this movie how anyone could ever fall asleep in a movie theater yet there I was snoring away

2015-05-13 00:43:45,3,0,3,The Imitation Game,out of interest why did you think this was better than the imitation game I literally cant comprehend that
2015-05-13 09:51:50,2,0,2,The Imitation Game,yeah I guess we all have our personal tastes personally I thought the imitation game was one of the greatest movies I have seen I need to watch the theory of everything actually I have heard many good things about it
2015-05-13 14:52:37,3,0,3,The Imitation Game,Im sorry are you replying to the wrong comment I didnt watch The Imitation Game I was just replying to your comment above I mean I agree totally that its bad form and I dont like to be lied to But I also dont really care To me people who get their historical knowledge or ideological stance from those kinds of movies just arent very bright in my opinion Unless it makes sense to view it in a real context Its whether the movie is enjoyable or not that matters to me I make a point of not watching reimaginations of historical events when I care about the characters This more interesting take on it could maybe also interest somebody in the life of Joan and the events that the movie is supposed to portray So to be honest it doesnt bother me People should be aware that its a big hollywood liveaction movie and they shouldnt confuse the movie with reality
2015-05-16 14:46:42,-1,0,-1,The Imitation Game,I think youre fine I just really dont think many adults will gravitate to Doctor Strange because of a fine performance in say The Imitation Game
2015-05-17 11:39:19,484,0,484,The Imitation Game,The Imitation Game It was a good movie but not great I didnt understand why it had all the Oscar and critic buzz

2015-05-19 15:43:33,0,0,0,The Imitation Game,Thanks I keep messing up the title in my head I just didnt like the movie at all I thought it was a chick flick also Im a chick Whiplash and Birdman were amazing in my opinion The Imitation Game I liked better than Theory of Everything
2015-05-19 23:18:49,6,0,6,The Imitation Game,Its moving forward The screenwriter of The Imitation Game who won an Academy Award for that script recently finalized the script

2015-05-21 12:22:55,2,0,2,The Imitation Game,The Imitation Game Its superb and itll make you feel like a genius
2015-05-22 02:02:07,1,0,1,The Imitation Game,I thought The Imitation Game did a fantastic job with that
2015-05-22 22:54:38,-4,0,-4,The Imitation Game,I dont understand aside from ol Harvey pulling his tricks how The Imitation Game was even nominated in the first place Its such a poorly structured film with an even more laughable sense of characterization that its clearly not even close to good
2015-05-23 06:35:27,1,0,1,The Imitation Game,I remember watching the trailer for The Imitation Game months after Id seen an early screening of the film and throughout the entire trailer my friends and I kept turning to each other and wondering out loud if anyone even needed to watch the actual film after sitting through the trailer
2015-05-23 20:55:19,2,0,2,The Imitation Game,Birdman The Imitation Game and Whiplash
2015-05-24 15:06:10,2,0,2,The Imitation Game,Just saw The Imitation Game last night The entire film is told by Alan Turring when he is interrogated by a detective
2015-05-24 18:07:48,7,0,7,The Imitation Game,I watched The Imitation Game last night with her in it and I actually really enjoyed the role she played in it
2015-05-24 20:53:48,1,0,1,The Imitation Game,I have to disagree as well Maybe if were judging her off of Pirates but I think she also had excellent performances in The Imitation Game Never Let Me Go and Anna Karenina as well

2015-05-27 18:07:04,5,0,5,The Imitation Game,Looks really good but they are making this look exactly like The Imitation Game Hopefully this is better than that film was but the PG13 rating makes me cautious
2015-05-27 18:34:50,2,0,2,The Imitation Game,I thought the same thing which is strange since I have yet to see The Imitation Game and have only seen trailers It ended and all I could think was Benedict Cumberbatch
2015-05-28 03:30:45,3,0,3,The Imitation Game,And The Imitation Game
2015-05-29 14:52:28,2,0,2,The Imitation Game,We arent getting original films  The last two movies I watched were Interstellar and the Imitation Game Its not like the original film industry is dead so going and seeing movies that look god awful like Tomorrowland isnt going to change the film industry
2015-05-29 14:58:21,7,0,7,The Imitation Game,gt American Sniper and The Imitation Game
2015-05-29 16:13:14,1,0,1,The Imitation Game,On the flip side of the coin from Mad Max which I cant wait to see The Imitation Game was incredible
2015-05-31 16:21:20,1,0,1,The Imitation Game,The Imitation Game I knew it was coming hut even when you know its coming a ton of bricks still hurts
2015-05-31 23:45:38,1,0,1,The Imitation Game,Several scenes from the Imitation Game That movie was beyond excellent and Im usually a Sci fi guy
2015-05-01 03:37:06,0,0,0,Ex Machina,Take the intelligence test see ex Machina and Avengers Age of Ultron and decide which is better
2015-05-01 04:57:44,6,0,6,Ex Machina,One thing thats worse than a Deus Ex Machina in my mind is a Deus Ex Machina that the heroes decide not to utilize Like a lot of people have said DoFPs Quicksilver was very overpowered and couldve solved the movies plot by himself
2015-05-01 16:24:19,1,0,1,Ex Machina,I think had Marvel known AoU would be coming out so soon after Ex Machina they would have changed the release date  To me AoU REALLY suffers in comparison  Their portrayal of AI and how it could interact with human beings was just so much better  Of course they are completely different movies as no one expects a Marvel movie to be anything but big dumb plots and huge CGI fests of fighting countless minions but thats exactly the problem  You dont have high expectations watching these movies and come away getting exactly what you expected
2015-05-01 17:17:56,2,0,2,Ex Machina,Ex Machina is showing in a theatre 15 hours away and It Follows has a single late show at my nearest theatre But I wasnt talking about those movies Those movies deserve to be encouraged
2015-05-01 20:14:20,7,0,7,Ex Machina,Everyone on Reddit has said to watch AoU in 2D there was a big thread about it and the movie has mixed to positive reviews while Ex Machina has only been critically praised
2015-05-01 20:40:36,3,0,3,Ex Machina,Terrible idea imo Ex Machina is great for one and Avengers will be in theaters for months you can see it any time when theres no crowd
2015-05-01 20:43:49,1,0,1,Ex Machina,Ex Machina is a much better movie That being said I had a lot of fun with AOU in IMAX 3D
2015-05-01 20:54:19,2,0,2,Ex Machina,I just saw the trailer for this at Ex Machina and I was blown away by how over the top action packed utterly insane it looked I think the price of gasoline must have gone up from the amount they had to burn just to film the trailer
2015-05-01 20:57:06,1,0,1,Ex Machina,so then its confirmed this was a piss poor deus ex machina trope to give him something to do and have Skarsguard pop up for a cameo

2015-05-02 14:52:50,1,0,1,Ex Machina,Without it being the ultimate Deus Ex Machina I really expected her to bring Quicksilver back to life and realize she had reality warping powers
2015-05-02 18:29:46,4,0,4,Ex Machina,Id love to see Alex Garland do it I thought Ex Machina was great and incidentally had 2 stars of the force awakens not to mention he wrote Dredd and 28 Days Later
2015-05-02 19:35:52,3,0,3,Ex Machina,Though Ex Machina does have suspense I wouldnt call it horror necessarily
2015-05-02 20:11:33,2,0,2,Ex Machina,The film made full use of deus ex machina both figuratively and literally

2015-05-04 20:09:19,2,0,2,Ex Machina,Saw this trailer in front of Ex Machina yesterday I think it looks exhilarating The upside down shot near the end where you can see the shadows on the side of the mountain gave me chills

2015-05-05 01:01:28,2,0,2,Ex Machina,I got to go with Age of Ultron  Need to see Ex Machina yet  Some decent movies this year but dont think this year is as good as last year  Most excited for Crimson Peak
2015-05-05 02:03:15,2,0,2,Ex Machina,There are always exceptions to the rule And while there have been wellreviewed movies like It Follows and Ex Machina I just dont see them getting much love at the Oscars
2015-05-05 02:44:04,1,0,1,Ex Machina,Ex Machina is the only realistic contender But its unlikely tbh because of how early it is
2015-05-05 03:29:54,1,0,1,Ex Machina,I havent seen much of anything so far From what Ive heard though Ex Machina is the earliest contender I feel like it may be forgotten about by the time awards season comes around but then again I thought the same thing about The Grand Budapest Hotel If it isnt forgotten about then maybe it will at least have a chance at a Best Picture nomination
2015-05-05 03:33:05,1,0,1,Ex Machina,gtDeus ex machina  a seemingly unsolvable problem is suddenly and abruptly resolved by the contrived and unexpected intervention of some new event character ability or object
2015-05-05 04:38:08,2,0,2,Ex Machina,Nope not at all  Maybe for special effects  I was just answering my favorite movie of the year part  I dont think there has been an oscar winning film so far that I have seen  Closes is Predestination but it might of counted for last year  Sounds like Ex Machina has an outside shot but I have not seen it yet  Want to
2015-05-05 04:55:46,2,0,2,Ex Machina,Oh I getchu I need to see Ex Machina as well
2015-05-05 06:45:16,2,0,2,Ex Machina,Yeah now I will admit that hype for big films always get to me and I jump on board But I never end up like them 100Furious 7 has a weak 3rd actAvengers 2 is a beautiful messetcbut I always love a good emotion driven film with great plot and character I dont mind Ex Machina Unfriended or It Follows these are just recent good  excellent experiences but thise much more fulfilling I want to see something great and remember it I dont want to pay to see something explode fly joke explode explode cliffhang Its borderline satisfying and boring but forgetton the next day It is the Oscar season and film festival films that make me happy I can kind if see myself in Phoenixs characterfresh off of a relationship and open to different options whether its attention love just whatever He gave his all just like a regular relationship but those damn insecurities would pop up at times and it was just hard to watch and beautiful to see that
2015-05-05 07:06:36,2,0,2,Ex Machina,You should love It Follows Whats your fav horror films Try to catch Ex Machina if you like scifi too The only Oscars buz that I didnt get was Selma Birdman to a little degree and Boyhood I wish Imitation Game won Best Picture but atleast it go its Best Adapted Screenplay
2015-05-05 13:56:25,1,0,1,Ex Machina,The saves ARE a bit deus ex machina but I was ok with them If it rings false then the move is too trite and easy otherwise we can live with it Always better of course if your hero can get out of it himself in some amazing unforeseen yet believable way
2015-05-05 17:55:02,6,0,6,Ex Machina,First off I really enjoyed Ex Machina however I described it as a very good movie I didnt enjoy I think the movie was shot really well and it had some interesting ideas but in my opinion the ending just fell off of having a really interesting story
2015-05-05 20:49:49,5,0,5,Ex Machina,Ex Machina and Enemy are amazing
2015-05-05 23:31:28,0,0,0,Ex Machina,I wouldnt call ex machina a psychological thriller Its fairly straightforward

2015-05-06 04:20:51,1,0,1,Ex Machina,Top Ex Machina It Follows Cinderella Kingsman and Unfriended its a good step in the right direction for horror as in trying new things and different mediums
2015-05-06 21:23:07,2,0,2,Ex Machina,I really liked Ex Machina It had an interesting and unique take on the typical AI becomes self aware story
2015-05-06 21:42:50,2,0,2,Ex Machina,I wouldnt call Ex Machina a thriller although it has some tense moments at the end But otherwise yeah  I think this article is a bit misguided because they are two completely different films trying to accomplish completely different things Ex Machina isnt even really about AI per se rather its used as a springboard for launching discussions of other aspects of human existence
2015-05-07 06:55:25,10,0,10,Ex Machina,Ive seen people say deus ex machina in reference to something that was entirely in keeping with the plot content and pacing of the film not an unbelievable shot from the blue to save the hero from a tight corner
2015-05-07 15:08:30,19,0,19,Ex Machina,The guy that made Ex Machina is doing more serious scifi Yeah Im in for this one
2015-05-07 16:48:50,1,0,1,Ex Machina,I have not seen it yet  It is at the top on my must see list at the moment with Ex Machina
2015-05-07 19:26:30,1,0,1,Ex Machina,Dredd 28 Days Later Sunshine Never Let Me Go and Ex Machina are some damn fine weekends work I gotta say His weekend work rivals just about anything being put out by anyone
2015-05-07 19:59:57,2,0,2,Ex Machina,One of the most promising new directors out Flexed some serious skill with ex machina i cant wait to see what else he does
2015-05-07 20:23:32,1,0,1,Ex Machina,This has been on IMDB for some time Im excited I love all his work and he has fully proven his capability with Ex Machina An all female team will be interesting Im sure he will add some more action than the books scientific heavy dialogue But hopefully it doesnt become to action packed Itll seem similar to the structure of The Martian Jessica Chastain should definitely join up haha
2015-05-07 20:38:12,0,0,0,Ex Machina,Origins was a terrible movie Can you say it was good with a straight face Everything about it was awful The way they portrayed Sabertooth as some paramilitary hitman lackey to the way the plot meandered from one deus ex machina to the next Even now its hard to remember because it was either unmemorable or Ive actively tried to suppress the memory Origins was supposed to be the first of several origin movies for XMen key players but even Fox the company that will literally produce anything including several virtually identical animated sitcoms thought it was so awful they abandoned the idea of doing more
2015-05-08 05:40:21,1,0,1,Ex Machina,I was really hoping to see Tim Allen and all of my other favorite Wild Hogs ride out in unison in a real Deus Ex Machina moment but thats just me
2015-05-08 08:11:10,2,0,2,Ex Machina,I havent seen this yet but I am really looking forward to seeing it soon   I love a good smart science fiction movie and every indication is that Ex Machina is exactly that
2015-05-08 08:47:09,1,0,1,Ex Machina,Saw Ex Machina back in January here in UK great film also a fan of Dredd and 28 Days Later good to see Garland becoming the hot new thing in Hollywood
2015-05-08 12:48:42,2,0,2,Ex Machina,This Im finally going to see Ex Machina today and I hope that I waited long enough where there is no one else in the theatre
2015-05-08 15:00:18,1,0,1,Ex Machina,Last I saw Agents of Shield it was atrocious and not worth watching just to understand the deus ex machina moments of Age of Ultron
2015-05-08 15:45:01,5,0,5,Ex Machina,I had to force myself to finish that series  Was just kind of ridiculous at times It started out really strong I think it was the season where the Mexican drug cartel ended up being CIA and basically just rolled in and Deus Ex Machina that bitch whoop were the CIA and now you work for us and the big climatic police showdown wont happen  Yea that was the turning point for me
2015-05-08 22:31:57,4,0,4,Ex Machina,Ex Machina  cant wait
2015-05-09 01:15:32,1,0,1,Ex Machina,Wanted to see Ex Machina but the times dont match up with my schedule Just gonna see Avengers again

2015-05-09 03:07:00,0,0,0,Ex Machina,But the story is not really written for Ex Machina yet We do not know what the box office will be like
2015-05-09 05:53:50,2,0,2,Ex Machina,But in that case its just a 3rd Act Deus Ex Machina It abandons the theme and the only message is If you screw up and violate everyones trustdo the same thing except magic
2015-05-09 07:14:44,1,0,1,Ex Machina,For any sort of future reference I think it be interesting to include Deus Ex Machina as well since people often consider it a plot hole

2015-05-09 08:27:21,1,0,1,Ex Machina,Well I just clicked on a post called Ex Machina Spoilers so I guess Im not really being careful about this at all am I Curiosity got the best of me
2015-05-09 11:32:39,1,0,1,Ex Machina,It was very well written and a great twist and deus ex machina to resolve the books conflicts that didnt feel like a cheap copout  Having said that it always bugged me that a 13 year old girl ended up with a device that could have disastrous consequences if misused
2015-05-09 12:40:35,1,0,1,Ex Machina,You have to write more realistically than real life because people will be less inclined to believe an unbelievable event in a story than in real life Sure maybe in some cases a person really does experiance a dues ex machina but that doesnt mean that makes for a good movie experience Just because something can happen doesnt mean it feels realistic If something crazy happens in real life we just have to accept it because it really happened
2015-05-09 14:27:14,14,0,14,Ex Machina,It could be worse Here in West Palm Beach they cut screenings of Ex Machina and havent picked up a lot of good new movies to make way for more screenings of blockbusters I wonder if people who like movies that arent blockbusters have stopped going to the theatre or if cinemas stopped carrying them to make more room for the Avengers
2015-05-09 14:39:15,5,0,5,Ex Machina,It is magic though at least in the theatrical sense Science is the deus ex machina of modern media if we have a problem we go to the old wizard in the wizards tower and he gives us a mysterious clue to help us solve the riddle
2015-05-09 16:42:40,18,0,18,Ex Machina,So far mine has been a tie between Kingsman and It Follows Ex Machina following close behind But I believe Mad Max might speed up in his interceptor and take the lead
2015-05-09 17:01:31,19,0,19,Ex Machina,Ex Machina and Kingsman for meOscar Isaac is so good in Ex Machina
2015-05-09 17:32:45,-1,0,-1,Ex Machina,But on a serious note for Ex Machina are we really going to let slide that the super genius thought the best course of action in the end was to beat it to death with a metal stick
2015-05-10 00:39:05,2,0,2,Ex Machina,Slaves They have like omnipotent machines What would be the point You see thats the movies main flaw is the motivation for both sides to have a conflict Zod wants to restore the krypton people from extinction and superman is like no for whatever reason And then Zod gets it and wreaks havoc for some reason Give Zod his peoples knowledge and tell him to go find someplace to go Done Superman only wins because of the standard deux ex machina trope
2015-05-10 04:22:08,0,0,0,Ex Machina,Totally I still dont think Ive seen the movie except in chunks on tv Very happy to see Garland getting some long deserved wider credit with Ex Machina which has got to be the reigning best film of the year so far
2015-05-10 05:05:37,2,0,2,Ex Machina,Hey it could be worse You could live in a small town with only one theatre and ex machina never even showed in your theatre even though you are dying to see it
2015-05-10 05:25:06,3,0,3,Ex Machina,It is interesting that when you search for Alicia Vikander and Oscar three of her nine movie scheduled movie appearances in 2015 are listed as potential acting Oscar nominations but Ex Machina isnt  The bias against science fiction and early year movies are rather strong in the Oscar nomination predictions
2015-05-10 05:54:54,-1,0,-1,Ex Machina,Yeah Ex Machina was great

2015-05-10 17:41:52,124,0,124,Ex Machina,Aronofsky or Alex Garland Darren Aronofsky is my favourite director but after seeing Ex MachinahttpswwwyoutubecomwatchvMw7GS_QBhU I also think Garland would be excellent for a live action GITS
2015-05-10 18:14:36,-1,0,-1,Ex Machina,Im not a huge scifi fan but I am interested in stories with AI and Ex Machina wasnt that deep or amazing to me It was like level 2 AI philosophy Where Level 1 introductory stuff is like I Robot
2015-05-10 18:18:41,102,0,102,Ex Machina,Ex Machina without a doubt The cinematography acting and story were absolutely phenomenal Definitely going to have to give it another watch sometime
2015-05-10 18:25:39,2,0,2,Ex Machina,Oscar Isaac getting no recognition seems to be a recurring theme Im optimistic that he might get a supporting nod for Ex Machina but Im well aware of how unlikely that is
2015-05-10 18:42:09,3,0,3,Ex Machina,For anyone that hasnt read Clive Cussler I enjoy almost every single part of his books however he always puts himself in the book as almost a deus ex machina role which gets very annoying
2015-05-10 19:01:46,1,0,1,Ex Machina,She loved Her Neither of us have seen Ex Machina so I will definitely be putting that on the list Thank you
2015-05-10 19:21:09,3,0,3,Ex Machina,Garland did Dredd right I need to watch Ex Machina then
2015-05-10 19:39:22,8,0,8,Ex Machina,Just watched Ex Machina Thought it was absolutely fantastic Isaac and Gleeson are some of the best actors working right now for sure
2015-05-10 20:00:40,7,0,7,Ex Machina,I will second Ex Machina as a die hard GITS fan It was by far the best AI focused movie I have seen in a while It wasnt contrived it wasnt predictable and it brings up great questions especially in regards to the initial schism between human and machine as opposed to an established AI universe
2015-05-10 20:15:01,-1,0,-1,Ex Machina,Ex Machina was not a good movie  Im sorry you think it is I do not mean that as an insult  It was a decent intro into this kind of thing  For the main stream its probably wonderful
2015-05-10 21:01:02,1,0,1,Ex Machina,I recently saw Ex Machina and while it was incredibly enjoyable to watch I think it would have been even more enjoyable if I hadnt known half the plot twists beforehand I expect Ill feel the same about Jurassic World but of course Ill go see it anyway But for my own moviegoing experience enhancement Im actively avoiding trailers

2015-05-11 02:19:53,2,0,2,Ex Machina,I agree After watching Age of Ultron and Ex Machina in the last couple of weeks I really miss the craft that went into Ghost in the Shells story as well especially the deep considerations of AI and ManMachine interface
2015-05-11 03:34:19,9,0,9,Ex Machina,Im a gigantic Marvel fan and of course saw Avengers 2 and I even left the theater thinking Ex Machina was my favorite film Ive seen this year and one of the best Ive seen the last several years Oscar Isaac was impressive and I cant wait to see him in Apocalypse
2015-05-11 04:01:23,1,0,1,Ex Machina,I will absolutely recommend Ex Machina to any sci fi fan I wouldnt recommend watching the trailers just watch the movie
2015-05-11 04:52:13,1,0,1,Ex Machina,You can believe him completely If you like GITS you WILL NOT be disappointed by Ex Machina Its the best science fiction movie I have seen in quite some time

2015-05-11 12:27:24,1,0,1,Ex Machina,gtFirst off I really enjoyed Ex Machina however I described it as a very good movie I didnt enjoy
2015-05-11 14:02:14,2,0,2,Ex Machina,I saw Ex Machina a few weeks ago It blew me way I saw the trailer a long time ago but didnt remember much from it Im glad I didnt because it spoiled a few things I just went off of the Rotten Tomatoes score and decided to go and see it Its one of the best scifi movies Ive seen since Moon

2015-05-11 15:14:51,54,0,54,Ex Machina,I also recommend Ex Machina if you like smart scifi
2015-05-11 15:22:12,1,0,1,Ex Machina,You forgot Ex Machina
2015-05-11 15:28:11,7,0,7,Ex Machina,I think its less about being able to follow the movie and more about the movie being an unsatisfying narrative experience Like Ive seen almost everything in Phase 2 and didnt really think the addition of Selvig for example did anything to further the plot besides make me think wait whose that guy again Similarly the appearance of the Helicarrier felt too much like a Deus Ex Machina  something to randomly bail the heroes out of a tough spot though apparently its been rebuilt in Agents of Shield
2015-05-11 15:54:14,614,0,614,Ex Machina,While I want to see this movie and appreciate the support you are giving this I think there is  another deserving movie for those who want riskyinteresting scifi Ex Machina

2015-05-11 16:36:40,1,0,1,Ex Machina,Indeed Im not particularly excited about Fury Road because it is yet another reboot Ex Machina was great and one reason is that it was new
2015-05-11 16:52:40,24,0,24,Ex Machina,Thats why you have us I go see the latest blockbusters or some random indie movie that was highly praised Ex Machina alone and come here to discuss it and see what everyone else thought of it
2015-05-11 17:02:47,1,0,1,Ex Machina,What about Ex Machina
2015-05-11 17:08:22,9,0,9,Ex Machina,I hope this creeps up to the top I am not an avid movie goer but I do like to support original ideas when I know of them Your comment put Ex machina on my radar and I will definitely be checking it out now so thanks D

2015-05-11 17:10:39,0,0,0,Ex Machina,100 on Rotten Tomatoes  Ive never seen a score like that for anything other than a foreign documentary   And while I have your attention go see Ex Machina  I saw it last weekend myself and then yesterday with my wife  It was great
2015-05-11 17:15:12,129,0,129,Ex Machina,I was going to mention it too Ex Machina was a masterpiece
2015-05-11 17:28:46,115,0,115,Ex Machina,I went and supported Ex Machina and have every intention of doing the same for Mad Max Both are Rrated risky ventures that I want more of
2015-05-11 17:33:27,1,0,1,Ex Machina,Ex Machina at 6 on NABO list for this weekend 35 M gross For as few screens as its playing on thats really pretty good

2015-05-11 17:38:38,7,0,7,Ex Machina,Its why I went and saw Ex Machina I want to support movies that I want to see more of
2015-05-11 17:52:04,1,0,1,Ex Machina,If you really wanted to see an original Sci Fi for adults you should have seen Ex Machina in theatres  Much better film
2015-05-11 18:18:26,3,0,3,Ex Machina,The point is the name the franchise People can say do you want to go see the new Mad Max movie as opposed to what the fuck is Ex Machina
2015-05-11 18:26:09,2,0,2,Ex Machina,So the squeal to Ex Machina will be crap because its not new and fresh
2015-05-11 18:32:49,2,0,2,Ex Machina,I wouldnt call Ex Machina terribly original It didnt expand the genre any more than Blade Runner That being said it was a fantastic film and one of my favorites of the year for sure

2015-05-11 18:46:34,8,0,8,Ex Machina,Alicia Vikander I saw her in a Royal Affair and it seems everyone wants her after that Ex Machina The Danish Girl with Tom Hooper and Eddie Redmayne The Light Between Oceans with Michael Fassbender
2015-05-11 18:50:54,1,0,1,Ex Machina,While were at it Go out and see Ex Machina  Do it now
2015-05-11 19:04:15,10,0,10,Ex Machina,Ex Machina was great Not perfect but an all around great experience and exactly the type of movie I want more of If you end up liking it and you like that style of scifi I strongly recommend checking out the British show called Black Mirror which you can find on Netflix
2015-05-11 19:10:07,1,0,1,Ex Machina,But I dont want more judge dredds edge of tomorrows or maybe even mad maxs Those movies are video game like action movies and comic book movies If they are movies for adults its pretty recent adults If I was wanting more sci fi and honestly I dont know that I do it would be in the vein of ex machina and under the skin Those are much more adult than mech warriors with video game lives
2015-05-11 19:36:18,1,0,1,Ex Machina,I am all for exciting scifi and action movies geared towards adults but why couldnt we get behind a nonremake maybe something like Ex Machina or Chappie
2015-05-11 20:10:26,2,0,2,Ex Machina,Couldnt have said it better myself Ive wanted to see Ex Machina ever since the trailer Whats interesting is that most of my friends take it as a joke and would rather see Avengers
2015-05-11 20:13:34,1,0,1,Ex Machina,Weve sunk so low that the latest remake is now considered a risky scifi property  This isnt Moon or Ex Machina
2015-05-11 20:22:32,2,0,2,Ex Machina,Go see Ex Machina for some really good smart adult and risky SciFi Mad Max will do fine
2015-05-11 20:33:01,1,0,1,Ex Machina,Originality is completely overrated There are only 7 stories to tell Its about the skill of the telling not whether shit is original The essence of Ex Machina is the exact same as the essence of Blade Runner and the two movies share several similar plot points True they feel very different but they really arent They are fundamentally the same just with different window dressing But even Blade Runner isnt original Its a rehash of the same What is human idea thats been done a million times
2015-05-11 20:35:15,1,0,1,Ex Machina,People keep saying that I have to see the original movies before seeing this one which was really deterring  Would you agree  I have trouble watching older films sometimes even if they are good and even if Ive seen them before and enjoyed them  At this point Im more inclined to see Ex Machina since Ill probably only be able to see one or the other in theaters
2015-05-11 20:52:43,2,0,2,Ex Machina,Fucking love Oscar Isaac Amazing in Inside Llewyn Davis A Most Violent Year and now Ex Machina He hasnt been in much but hes already showing a huge range and a hell of a lot of talent Quickly becoming one of our best working actors I really want him to win an Oscar ha soon but it makes me sad that his considerable talents are being used on less exhibitory roles like Apocalypse and Star Wars
2015-05-11 21:11:28,1,0,1,Ex Machina,Can you please share that Ex machina was so amazing
2015-05-11 21:19:10,-1,0,-1,Ex Machina,Its better than Ex Machina
2015-05-11 21:25:06,0,0,0,Ex Machina,Dont see how Ex Machina is relevant to this thread
2015-05-11 21:28:04,1,0,1,Ex Machina,Saw Ex Machina yesterday First time in awhile that I watched a movie whilst on the edge of my seat
2015-05-11 21:35:14,1,0,1,Ex Machina,Damn I really regret not seeing Ex Machina now I totally wanted to but never got round to it and then figured Id have to wait for home media Now youve made me feel bad about not supporting it because it looks like the sort of thing Id love Plus I should support the British film industry since I am British
2015-05-11 21:45:49,3,0,3,Ex Machina,Fury Road has a budget of 150m so literally 10 times the risk  Ex Machina will be successful if seen by diehard sci if fans or people who want a movie that is above the level of standard Hollywood brain dead blockbuster
2015-05-11 22:08:27,1,0,1,Ex Machina,Ex Machina is an British science fiction movie made on the cheap Its considered an independent movie because it was made outside the studio system or because Universals involvement is being seriously downplayed for indie cred The movie is called a safe bet because it can easily make triple its production cost in limited release on VoD and through DVD sales
2015-05-11 22:18:48,3,0,3,Ex Machina,Same goes with Ex Machina
2015-05-11 22:58:15,2,0,2,Ex Machina,Whenever i see a dagger in books and movies i cant help but think of Hamlet Ava is our Hamlet character in Ex Machina In her existential moment she decides to acts and uses the dagger In Ex Machina AI wants to be alive

2015-05-11 23:15:19,0,0,0,Ex Machina,Also try to catch Ex Machina before it leaves theatres Fantastic scifi movie and its not a sequel remake or based on a book which is great to see in mainstream theatres
2015-05-12 00:27:07,3,0,3,Ex Machina,Oh for sure Ive been watching Black Mirror on Netflix as of late which has a very Twilight feel to it Ex Machina could have easily been an episode of that series
2015-05-12 00:42:11,0,0,0,Ex Machina,i was actually thinking of seeing this and i rarely see movies Ex Machina was fucking good though i doubt this movie can top it
2015-05-12 01:02:33,1,0,1,Ex Machina,gt Ex Machina is risky because its an original cerebral scifi film with no action and no super A list stars
2015-05-12 01:04:17,0,0,0,Ex Machina,As far as adult scifi goes Ex Machina was also quite good
2015-05-12 01:14:20,2,0,2,Ex Machina,I dont watch Agents of Shield and the Helicarrier was a complete Deux Ex Machina moment for me and an incredibly obvious one Really deflated the tension in those moments for me
2015-05-12 01:15:54,-1,0,-1,Ex Machina,Also go see Ex Machina for this reason
2015-05-12 01:21:10,2,0,2,Ex Machina,Wow anyone else super pumped for Oscar Issac as Apocalypse He was phenomenal in A Most Violent Year and Ex Machina
2015-05-12 04:26:46,1,0,1,Ex Machina,Ex machina was one of the best films Ive ever seen its still in theaters and everyone should go see it
2015-05-12 05:12:59,1,0,1,Ex Machina,I actually drove for an hour to see Ex Machina because it wasnt playing locally  It was worth it
2015-05-12 06:30:41,65,0,65,Ex Machina,Ex Machina in theaters now

2015-05-12 18:22:12,5,0,5,Ex Machina,I walked away from Ex Machina with a weird feeling because of exactly that Then I read this essayhttpbirthmoviesdeathcom20150511filmcrithulksmashexmachinaandtheartofcharacteridentification by Film Crit Hulk warning HULKSPEAK and made peace with it Its all about who you identify with
2015-05-12 18:31:14,3,0,3,Ex Machina,Its a complicated issue for sure Ive seen critics damn it for its misogyny and praise it for its feminism Just google Ex Machina  feminist  misogynist and youll get tons of results
2015-05-12 18:57:07,29,0,29,Ex Machina,Automata wishes it could be as lean and compelling as Ex Machina
2015-05-12 19:06:30,2,0,2,Ex Machina,On the contrary I think Ex Machina makes a profoundly feminist statement
2015-05-12 19:57:19,81,0,81,Ex Machina,Oscar Isaac is becoming one of my favorite actors With his subtle part in Drive leading In Llewyn Davis A Most Violent Year was great and stealing every scene of Ex Machina He deserves a supporting nom for his role
2015-05-12 20:40:35,34,0,34,Ex Machina,This will be the year that changes his career forever A Most Violent Year Ex Machina and then Star Wars VII
2015-05-12 20:49:02,19,0,19,Ex Machina,YES Though Mad Max looks friggin awesome and since it will do well probably will help more than Ex Machina with the same goal in mind
2015-05-12 21:10:44,1,0,1,Ex Machina,IMDB has six films listed as being released in 2015  five that I mentioned not The Circle which is in preproduction and Ex Machina  But movies like Son of a Gun Seventh Son and Testament of Youth which she had roles in are listed under 2014 even though some were released in 2015 in some markets  So if you include those three with the six I mentioned youd get to nine  Maybe thats the maths behind that number
2015-05-12 21:47:59,9,0,9,Ex Machina,Realistically a dude on Reddit wont make Ex Machina which doesnt even play in alot of cities go 1 Its much more realistic to push Mad Max which could either make a lot or a little Lets not make this BUT MY R RATED FILM IS BETTERRRRRR
2015-05-13 00:02:16,1,0,1,Ex Machina,Ex Machina was the best time I had in theaters since Wolf of Wall Street
2015-05-13 00:28:46,1,0,1,Ex Machina,It was the Deus Ex Machina Pool in the Cave of Exposition
2015-05-13 00:33:49,2,0,2,Ex Machina,I see posts about Ex Machina every single day on here
2015-05-13 02:32:44,6,0,6,Ex Machina,gtEx Machina is everything you want
2015-05-13 02:44:01,-1,0,-1,Ex Machina,Great observation Though I do love the ending of 28 Days Later I thought it fit perfectly there not so much with Ex Machina
2015-05-13 04:35:15,7,0,7,Ex Machina,Ex Machina was one of very few recent movies I can say Im glad to have paid to see
2015-05-13 04:36:44,4,0,4,Ex Machina,Yeah I dont think it had the elements necessary to suck you in like Ex Machina did
2015-05-13 04:41:16,14,0,14,Ex Machina,Very recently Nathan Oscar Isaac from Ex Machina
2015-05-13 06:02:39,7,0,7,Ex Machina,Same here hes great Hes good in pretty everything Ive seen him in His episode of black mirror is really good and he was awesome in Ex Machina as well
2015-05-13 06:07:38,1,0,1,Ex Machina,O I loved his acting in Ex Machina  and now I know i recognize him from Drive  he looks like he put on weight though
2015-05-13 11:46:41,3,0,3,Ex Machina,The movie is Ex Machina for anyone wondering
2015-05-13 16:36:12,4,0,4,Ex Machina,Sorry Ex Machina already doubled its budget and received critical praise
2015-05-13 19:02:44,3,0,3,Ex Machina,Wow some women like many men are brain dead action movie fans that cant stand great movies with no explosions  Ex Machina is a prefect length for those who have adult attention spans
2015-05-13 19:49:13,2,0,2,Ex Machina,Yeah I dont expect the Avengers to be Ex Machina but Ultron keeps spouting about humanity needing to evolve  but his words are really empty cuz he decides to just kill everybody
2015-05-13 20:34:56,13,0,13,Ex Machina,Hes quickly becoming one of my favorite actors in Hollywood His recent role in Ex Machina was fucking awesome
2015-05-13 20:50:37,1,0,1,Ex Machina,Amazing I actually thought that he also did the recent Garland film Ex Machina soundtrack but turns out it was a different team But they sound thematically similar see herehttpswwwyoutubecomwatchvxuWeMFmCvjEampindex9amplistPL5HkXohAfcb0CsOTzRt7s1nwpANb6puqt so I dont think they could go wrong with either choice
2015-05-13 21:24:28,8,0,8,Ex Machina,I saw A Most Violent Year Ex Machina and Agora really the odd one out in the span of a week
2015-05-13 23:43:38,1,0,1,Ex Machina,Im curious have you seen either The Machine or Automata  If you have Id love to hear your thoughts  If not theyre both on Netflix US and worth your time IMO  I havent seen Ex Machina yet but it looks a bit like The Machine 2013 and Automata 2014 Antonio Banderas was very reminiscent of Blade Runner to me
2015-05-14 00:52:34,8,0,8,Ex Machina,I hope he is  Whenever a movie like this comes along I always hope people go see it  This year thats been Kingsman and Ex Machina and now Mad Max All very different but deserve attention in the box office If we dont put our money in our mouths  how can we ask the industry to make more ballsy movies that we need for the art of film to evolve
2015-05-14 01:57:26,1,0,1,Ex Machina,I honestly think Oscar Isaac is one of the best up and coming actors Ever since I saw him in Inside Llewyn Davis Ive been excited to see what he was going to do next Last year he was in A Most Violent Year which was one of my favorite films of the year Last month Ex Machina started showing and although I havent seen it yet I can probably guess he is great in it as well
2015-05-14 02:08:36,-2,0,-2,Ex Machina,Mmm Deus Ex Machina the series

2015-05-15 02:04:33,23,0,23,Ex Machina,Without a doubt one of the best films of the year and this is coming from a guy who adored Ex Machina
2015-05-15 02:28:10,3,0,3,Ex Machina,Ex Machina wasnt big and flashy and full of action but man it sticks with you
2015-05-15 02:32:43,3,0,3,Ex Machina,Just got back from seeing Ex Machina  I really enjoyed it
2015-05-15 02:33:18,6,0,6,Ex Machina,Ex Machina probably one of the better AI movies to come out recently
2015-05-15 03:55:29,-7,0,-7,Ex Machina,bigger rmovies circle jerk mad max or ex machina
2015-05-15 05:01:29,3,0,3,Ex Machina,Go get yourself a double dose of awesome with Ex Machina and Mad Max
2015-05-15 05:35:50,1,0,1,Ex Machina,Ex Machina Just watched it an hour ago Still questioning my existence
2015-05-15 05:56:52,1,0,1,Ex Machina,Im debating whether Kingsman or Fury Road is my favorite of the year so far It Follows and Ex Machina close behind them Fury Road was just so high octane action packed and what a spectacle
2015-05-15 07:40:29,2,0,2,Ex Machina,Havent watched Ex Machina yet but Fury Road was definitely better than Age of Ultron
2015-05-15 13:25:58,1,0,1,Ex Machina,This For movies with logic plot devices and introspection all of which I also love Ill see Inception or Ex Machina With Batman or Mad Max Im getting action figures and explosions more eye candy and exuberance than logic or plot Theres room for both just buckle up and enjoy the ride
2015-05-15 14:30:15,38,0,38,Ex Machina,Its a very Deus ex Machina type resolution that undercuts the heroism of Middle Earths heroes Basically they couldnt have won without supernatural intevention whereas in the books the victory won by Aragorn and his reinforcements in the books he had a bunch of elves and rangers with him in addition to Gimli and Legolas iirc is hardfought My favorite scene is when Aragorn and Eomer meet up on the battlefield and have a quick chat
2015-05-15 14:32:14,8,0,8,Ex Machina,But I think the point was the army of men in the film simply were not going to overcome both the men from the east and Saurons orcs Is it a deus ex machina kind of But it doesnt really save the day since Sauron at that stage still had all of Mordor and 10000 orcs
2015-05-15 14:35:27,30,0,30,Ex Machina,Honestly one of my big problems with the LOTR films is almost every battle ends with a big deus ex machina force coming in to completely save the day
2015-05-15 14:36:46,70,0,70,Ex Machina,gtIts a very Deus ex Machina
2015-05-15 14:49:26,0,0,0,Ex Machina,I dont want to be that guy but lots of TLOR is very Deus Ex MachinaI mean the movies not the booksLike everyone is saved by giant eagles and Gandalf is brought back to life by God
2015-05-15 14:57:38,22,0,22,Ex Machina,But literally anyone could have gone and got a hold of Eomer I wouldnt call it Deus ex Machina when Heracles diverts a river to clean the augean stables so I would not call it that when Gandalf rides off to get reinforcements
2015-05-15 15:04:52,2,0,2,Ex Machina,Well then none of the battles end in a deus ex machina
2015-05-15 15:14:39,29,0,29,Ex Machina,gtHow is it a Deus Ex Machina
2015-05-15 15:17:02,1,0,1,Ex Machina,I think its more about the fact that those reinforcements are invulnerable and unstoppable Yes there is plenty of back story before they show up on the fields But as they are searching for more men before the battle Aragorn is suddenly informed that there is an invulnerable ghost army beholden to him inside this mountain It can definitely be argued that their introduction is somewhat Deus ex Machina not their arrival at the fields
2015-05-15 15:17:50,13,0,13,Ex Machina,Deus ex machina requires it to not be set up beforehand like if the riders of Rohan won the battle entirely that wouldnt be deus ex machina
2015-05-15 15:18:29,5,0,5,Ex Machina,It was already expected that Gandalf would show up Not a deus ex machina
2015-05-15 15:30:42,2,0,2,Ex Machina,gt I think theyre cool in the books but the glowing green deus ex machina made the Pelenor Fields way less enjoyable
2015-05-15 15:43:20,1,0,1,Ex Machina,Thats not a deus ex machina though The plan was always to hold out at Helms Deep until Gandalf brought reinforcements
2015-05-15 15:55:33,3,0,3,Ex Machina,It isnt a Deus Ex Machina If you told me it historically happened thats one thing but this is a story that was written Someone made this up He simply could and did make this up better Jackson just decided to change it for the worse
2015-05-15 15:55:37,0,0,0,Ex Machina,To be fair deus ex machina saving the day was kind of a big point of the books in general Tolkein specifically wanted Gollum to destroy the ring by accident to show that no one not even Frodo had the willpower to destroy it and that it would take divine intervention at the last to see it done
2015-05-15 15:56:51,17,0,17,Ex Machina,Actually the word youre thinking of eucatastrophe good catastrophe Essentially its an unexpected turn of events that is good however it almost always follows the rules of the world Its a pretty common thing in myths throughout time as Tolkien lays out in his essay On Faerie Stories A deus ex machina is where the thing that saves the day is completely outside of the world or completely new to the audience But Tolkiens are usually set up well in advance and are in line with the world as a whole This is not to say you cant still be grumpy because it feels convenient but its not a deus ex machina
2015-05-15 16:18:52,1,0,1,Ex Machina,Maybe he made those changes because he believed it worked better as opposed to the book version  If you dont expand their role enough then they would look like an even BIGGER deus ex machina than they already were  And if you show them help out in battle by having an invincible force taking the boats then it would stand to reason that they would help out for the remainder of the battle
2015-05-15 16:30:54,1,0,1,Ex Machina,pretty sure most viewers would still consider the whole fellowship to be heroes and so even if you consider it deus ex machina it hardly undercuts the heroism of Middle Earths heroes
2015-05-15 16:42:24,1,0,1,Ex Machina,Gollum was deus ex machina because him just biting the ring finger
2015-05-15 19:47:14,1,0,1,Ex Machina,Im gonna say it follows Ex Machina is in my opinion better I really would recommend It Follows I loved it
2015-05-15 21:51:53,5,0,5,Ex Machina,Ex Machina this movie went beyond my expectations and I thought it was nearly perfect
2015-05-16 01:59:23,4,0,4,Ex Machina,Blade Runner is similar in some ways and a big influence on this movie The Directors Cut is my favorite version Calebs razor blade scene reminded me of the unicorn dream in Blade Runner The dream suggested that the protagonist was not who he seemed  but in Ex Machina Caleb removes any doubt of that Also
2015-05-16 02:12:13,-14,0,-14,Ex Machina,Gee just what rmovies needs another post about Ex Machina Why not search before posting and see theres no shortage of places to discuss EM
2015-05-16 03:15:10,1,0,1,Ex Machina,Aliens 3 was cool man Im might read the Martian myself why not the synopsis sounds amazing but we need more movies like this science fiction is not ex machina to me its mission to Mars if you get what Im saying
2015-05-16 03:36:58,1,0,1,Ex Machina,Just watched Ex Machina and that definitely fits the bill I really enjoyed The Babadook and Honeymoon was on a horror kick for a while still kind of am About to watch Gone Girl for the first time
2015-05-16 03:42:38,5,0,5,Ex Machina,Most fun Ive had in the theaters in a long time  Its early in the summer movie season but its the best summer film of 2015 so far probably not going to lose that top likely to end up on my 10 best I saw in 2015 and right now is the second best movie Ive seen in 2015 second only to Ex Machina
2015-05-16 03:50:53,1,0,1,Ex Machina,its completely different Ex Machina is an art film Blade Runner is excellent thought provoking yes but not the same
2015-05-16 03:58:35,3,0,3,Ex Machina,It was a bit boring to be honest I had just saw Ex Machina the night before so maybe my standards were set too high
2015-05-16 04:08:45,7,0,7,Ex Machina,Ex Machina was beautiful on the big screen Likewise Interstellar and Gravity were some magical in theaters
2015-05-16 04:55:02,6,0,6,Ex Machina,Its a scifi classic so I highly recommend that you do That film has been so influential Alex Garland the director of Ex Machina was well aware of Blade Runner as he was making this film
2015-05-16 04:58:14,1,0,1,Ex Machina,I would love a full length Avengers side movie where the characters are just hanging outdoing normal shitfucking around The lift the hammer scene was my favorite in the whole movie and my 2nd favorite scene of this year so far next to the Ex Machina dance sequence
2015-05-16 05:23:52,1,0,1,Ex Machina,Welcome to last week OP circlejerking about AoU being bler and Joss Sweden being dumb is old news Now were circlejerking about Mad Max being the best thing ever made Somewhere a European poster is still trying to circlejerk to Ex Machina as well
2015-05-16 05:31:04,5,0,5,Ex Machina,I watched The Machine in Netflix a couple months ago and its a pretty good film In fact a few minutes into Ex Machina I recommended The Machine to the friends I was watching with if they ended up liking Ex Machina
2015-05-16 07:12:50,1,0,1,Ex Machina,maybe explain at the top too how Ex Machina and The Machine are not very similar lol
2015-05-16 08:38:30,4,0,4,Ex Machina,So how do you pronounce ex machina
2015-05-16 09:09:02,8,0,8,Ex Machina,You really think no human would sacrifice another for their own survival If history has taught us anything its that humans will do exactly that When I first saw this movie I saw it as complementary to Her While Samantha shows her sentience and humanity through lovecompassion Ava shows hers through her survival instincts and selfpreservation Both are equally human Avas actions are just a bit harder to accept and I loved that about Ex Machina
2015-05-16 10:48:20,32,0,32,Ex Machina,I think its a bad movie overall but its got a lot of good elements going for it I thought it was really good visually Chappies CGI looked awesome and most of the action was well done also Blokmkamp just knows how to make the Johannesburg slums look beautiful Sharlto Copley made Chappie a very entertaining character and I did like Ninja and Yolandi at times The movie had me interested for the first 30 minutes or so but then it just went off in a strange direction and once Hugh Jackmans storyline came in the pacing was just awful It could have done something interesting with the AI conciousness thing  like what Ex Machina did more recently but instead they turned it into a shitty plot device The movie was just a lot of wasted potential for a great SciFi flick
2015-05-16 11:23:17,2,0,2,Ex Machina,Ex Machina took a lot of similar themes and ideas from Blade Runner and made a good movie out of them
2015-05-16 11:48:45,0,0,0,Ex Machina,Ex Machina There is not a single frame of the movie I thought couldve been better Its the best scifi film Ive seen in a long time
2015-05-16 12:06:04,1,0,1,Ex Machina,Fury ex machina But I loved the Vision
2015-05-16 12:23:47,4,0,4,Ex Machina,Thats the second time someone has related Ex Machina to Blade Runner I guess its definitely time to give Blade Runner a shot
2015-05-16 12:29:24,9,0,9,Ex Machina,He probably means Mad Max Ex Machina and It Follows
2015-05-16 12:31:29,337,0,337,Ex Machina,If youre interested in supllementary reading after seeing Ex Machina I recommend Superintelligence Paths Dangers StrategieshttpwwwamazoncomSuperintelligenceDangersStrategiesNickBostromdp0199678111refsr_1_1sbooksampieUTF8ampqid1431779200ampsr11ampkeywordssuperintelligencepathsdangersstrategies by Nick Bostrom He goes into some depth as to the dangers related to trying to contain a strong AI and even the possibility that a sufficiently well informed AI could employ social persuasion to achieve their goals All relevant to Alex Garlands movie
2015-05-16 12:32:01,2,0,2,Ex Machina,I think its going to be a great year in movies Between the already released great movies Kingsman It Follows Ex Machina Mad Max Fury Road and the upcoming ones that look to be good Tomorrowland Jurassic World although this may be more of a personal bias Star Wars The Revenant Bridge of Spies Carol Inside Out Southpaw Ricki and the Flash Crimson Peak Black Mass etc this year just looks amazing
2015-05-16 12:33:36,0,0,0,Ex Machina,I wouldnt call Ex Machina or It Follows the best of their genres in decades they were really good though but I think Id definitely be as bold to say Mad Max Fury Road is the best action movie in a long time
2015-05-16 12:44:01,-4,0,-4,Ex Machina,Your list might as well be a Top 10 of the last 4 years because nothing on there came out before 2011 Really You put Ex Machina on there Its literally just come out and its one of your favourite films from the last 10 years It will be forgotten by this time next year Your list is just reactionary these are the films you watched most recently so they are your favourite films from the last 10 years Utter bollocks Go look at what came out before 2010 and I guarantee you will find films you like more than pretty much every film on this list unless you literally started watching films in 2011
2015-05-16 13:23:32,1,0,1,Ex Machina,Mad max  ex Machina  Kingsman
2015-05-16 13:28:01,2,0,2,Ex Machina,The whole point is that the AI in Ex Machina might well have been that capable in its final iterations  The fact that it was able to socially engineer its way out of captivity indicates such
2015-05-16 13:49:19,0,0,0,Ex Machina,Why do his favorite films upset you so much Who cares if there arent any from earlier years maybe they didnt affect him as much as the films he listed OP asked for YOUR FAVORITE FILMS not BEST FILMS of the last decade Ex Machina is a great film and maybe you didnt like it but he will probably remember it by this time next year Dont be so insulted by someone elses fun
2015-05-16 13:52:38,77,0,77,Ex Machina,You should check out Black Mirror if you havent outside of the first episode it is some excellent scifi the first ep is good but a little more grounded in today Ex Machina felt like an extended episode of that show which is probably one of the reasons I liked it so much or maybe just because it was damn good I hope to see Garland do a bit more scifi him and Duncan Jones should team up and do an anthology flick
2015-05-16 14:11:27,25,0,25,Ex Machina,I went home after the movie and had a Black Mirror marathon based on a recommendation in an Ex Machina thread It was incredible and I had a wonderful Sci Fi Sunday
2015-05-16 14:22:36,1,0,1,Ex Machina,gt I highly doubt any AI would act like the ones in Ex Machina although I loved the movie  they would be more like gods and they would know it
2015-05-16 14:28:34,73,0,73,Ex Machina,How about leaving a unique creative movie for what it is I dont get why people have this need for prequels or sequels The ending of Ex Machina left me with a lot of questions and feelings another movie would ruin that IMO
2015-05-16 14:33:14,64,0,64,Ex Machina,Some people just arent interested in the topic They dont have to misunderstand something to dislike it Even for me interested in tech and the future the movie was pretty slow So I can see why some people wouldnt like Ex Machina I loved it and thought it was an eye opener though
2015-05-16 14:44:36,0,0,0,Ex Machina,I just watched the movie yesterday and I woke up to 3 Ex Machina posts on reddit whoaaa
2015-05-16 16:00:34,2,0,2,Ex Machina,I saw a panel with Alex Garland and several of the actors in the movie at SXSW before I had even seen the movie I was really impressed with how much thought they had put into AI and the philosophical ideas guiding most of the movie Its one of those things you cant tell immediately from the movie but the subtle influences of it make Ex Machina a far better film
2015-05-16 16:04:14,15,0,15,Ex Machina,I think its valid not that someones subjective opinion of a movie needs to be validated to critique Ex Machina for this detail Its pretty out of character for a guy who is a genius when it comes to technology and who deeply values his privacy and security to have such a massive hole in his home security system and this hole in the security system plays a major part in the climax of the film That being said its also perfectly valid to willingly suspend your disbelief for this I did and I enjoyed the movie But there have been plenty times an otherwise decent movie has been ruined for me due to a detail like this one
2015-05-16 16:08:52,1,0,1,Ex Machina,Because people want to get deeper into the story  They want to know what happens  Thats the whole reason you read a story or watch a movie and thats to know what happens  In the case with Ex Machina it leaves you with many questions questions that some people wouldnt mind seeing answered or explained
2015-05-16 16:10:56,-1,0,-1,Ex Machina,I liked Ex Machina but I think Black Mirror is terrible It feels like its all concept and no execution
2015-05-16 16:18:20,0,0,0,Ex Machina,sEx Machina
2015-05-16 16:19:43,20,0,20,Ex Machina,I think glossing over the hard parts is a nod to the phrase deus ex machine which refers to a plot device that uses unexplained godly intervention or in this case the creation of the AI wet ware brain When Caleb gets locked in the room at the end this would be the ideal place for the movie to use deus ex machina in the plot to let him escape somehow However the title is Ex Machina with deus or god removed referring to the fact that no godly intervention will happen and Caleb is trapped for the rest of his life
2015-05-16 16:34:17,2,0,2,Ex Machina,Black Mirror is fantastic I just finished Ex Machina and I too thought about that show
2015-05-16 16:34:22,1,0,1,Ex Machina,Mad Max is amazing visually It lacked in character development but still was amazing Not better than Ex Machina in my opinion though
2015-05-16 17:02:08,2,0,2,Ex Machina,I loved Ex Machina but I didnt think it was deep in the slightest personally
2015-05-16 17:34:01,2,0,2,Ex Machina,I watched it directly after Ex Machina Very interesting to see two completely different takes regarding AI It was a solid film but I feel as if the film shouldve solely focused on Chappies humanistic development instead of the bank heist subplot
2015-05-16 17:37:34,1,0,1,Ex Machina,You guys seem to equate slow to boring or bad This isnt the case And no offense but I dont need movies explained to me Whichever way you look at it youd be lying if you said Ex Machina wasnt slow overall
2015-05-16 17:39:46,2,0,2,Ex Machina,Im just surprised that this movie seems to inspire so much love from people when other AI based movies arent  Other than a lot of naked chicks Ex Machina seems to drag on
2015-05-16 17:43:19,5,0,5,Ex Machina,Ex Machina
2015-05-16 17:53:31,1,0,1,Ex Machina,Funnily enough Ex Machina was the last film I watched just before Chappie too I loved both movies
2015-05-16 18:02:53,14,0,14,Ex Machina,Depends on your mood Both are great and worth seeing and supporting financially If you want a quiet smart chamber piece go see Ex Machina If you want balls to wall action and spectacle see Mad Max
2015-05-16 18:06:46,7,0,7,Ex Machina,Well if u have to chose i think you should pick Mad Max for the cinema experienceBut both movies are fucking awesome and you should watch them both at some pointBut i feel like its more important to see Mad Max in cinema than Ex MachinaHf tonight
2015-05-16 18:06:54,-1,0,-1,Ex Machina,Ex Machina has already made money Mad Max needs your money
2015-05-16 18:53:32,1,0,1,Ex Machina,Indeed The trailer hooked me but I expected it to be faster paced I was also surprised at how well they kept us intrigued with it being slow Overall the movie was just well done Definitely following Alex Garland the director now I believe he wrote and produced 28 Days  Weeks Later also Ex Machina is pretty amazing for a first time director
2015-05-16 19:53:40,2,0,2,Ex Machina,That one in Ex Machina
2015-05-16 20:12:52,0,0,0,Ex Machina,OP just said your Top 10 from the last decade so it could be either who knows who cares I was pointing out how his list of films seemed very reactionary which I stand by considering Ex Machina is on there and it has literally been what a month since it came out Its a bit of a claim for it to be in your top 10 films of the last decade at least give it a second watch and wait for the circlejerk around it to die down God forbid anyone ever says anything bad about Ex Machina on this sub I didnt even say if I liked it or not and Ive been downvoted Under what the guy replied to me I understand his choice of films as he was under the impression that it was 2011 onwards so I apologize for being snarky and a bit arrogant
2015-05-16 20:35:35,2,0,2,Ex Machina,Its my best movie for 2015 so far along with Ex Machina
2015-05-16 20:51:49,3,0,3,Ex Machina,EX MACHINA is very well written and executed It has a logic and doesnt simply trick the audience without making a reasonable argument for deflecting the truth in one moment At the end you understand exactly how and why things happened the way they did
2015-05-16 21:11:39,3,0,3,Ex Machina,man I do enjoy JJ Abrams stuff too I mean it is at least entertaining Ex Machina isnt perfect but I still think it is a quality sci fi Its kinda like lobster but I like burgers too you know what I mean
2015-05-16 21:19:47,160,0,160,Ex Machina,I root for movies that I love so the genre can flourish and more movies like it can be made  Dredd Ex Machina are examples
2015-05-16 21:29:23,3,0,3,Ex Machina,Ex Machina currently
2015-05-16 21:39:02,1,0,1,Ex Machina,If you liked Ex Machina I think you would like Automata  I randomly found it on Netflix and watched it and I was very surprised that Id never even heard of it  I think it may be my favorite AI movie
2015-05-16 21:42:24,1,0,1,Ex Machina,I definitely wouldnt call it action packed but I thought it was more exciting than Ex Machina  In Ex Machina they main characters literally have the AI moral discussions in front of you where as in Automata you kind of watch a human discover the intricacies of those questions as the plot unfolds  I find that more intriguing  I think that if you like genuinely like AI movies then watching it sober so you can really follow allowing would be a good idea
2015-05-16 22:18:42,1,0,1,Ex Machina,Theres no reason to believe a sequel wouldnt be equally smart and creative even if the allegory in it is different I think there is a lot of ground to cover around the ideas Ex Machina explored and I would trust the team to do it Id LOVE to see another movie in the vein of Ex Machina and if the first movie is any indication Id probably go see it twice
2015-05-16 22:42:50,31,0,31,Ex Machina,Ex Machina was soo good I was totally surprised with how much I loved it
2015-05-16 22:43:36,3,0,3,Ex Machina,Both movies are great but Mad Max needs to be seen in theaters more because its so spectacular It has a lot of deep meaning hidden behind its flashy visuals but I will say theyre more related to humanity and modern society than Ex Machina which is much more focused on the future
2015-05-16 22:45:59,-6,0,-6,Ex Machina,it was really flawed tho ex machina was pretty much perfect
2015-05-16 23:02:51,2,0,2,Ex Machina,I think its much simpler Ava said she wanted to go to a traffic intersection and she went to a traffic intersection Ex Machina actually did something pretty unique among AI fiction which doesnt call for heavy were being replaced metaphors Theres no superhuman AI or widespread use of humanoid robots Theres just one AI blending in with no master not being hunted or on a mission to create more copies Besides the murders its not particularly ominous or grand and its a really nice change in perspective from what we usually get
2015-05-16 23:17:06,1,0,1,Ex Machina,matrix was original and mindblowingly entertaining insterstellar was justidk not as good as matrix or ex machina i usually love nolans movies but interstellar was kinda meh compared to his other stuff
2015-05-16 23:22:24,2,0,2,Ex Machina,I think she does pass the classic Turing test but the during test only tests if a machine is of humanlike intelligence not if the machine is able to feel like a human The ending prove to me that Ex Machina spoilers s Ava wasnt able to feel empathy Nathan constructed an AI that was more intelligent than humans but he wasnt able to emulate real emotions or feelings towards other beings
2015-05-16 23:27:08,1,0,1,Ex Machina,well you have a point with inception the other movies arent better scifi movies than ex machina imo eternal sunshine and her were really good dramedy movies and edge of tomorrow was a fantastic action movie but would you honestly even describe these movies as scifi movies
2015-05-17 00:09:51,-1,0,-1,Ex Machina,I dont agree that this is the best scifi since The Matrix though The Matrix is only really good because it was groundbreaking at the time  It has much more flaws than Ex Machina and probably wouldnt hold up all that well if you showed it to someone who had never seen it before  Primer and District 9 are in my opinion better than The Matrix
2015-05-17 01:48:37,1,0,1,Ex Machina,These are two quite different movies Choose the one that sparks the deepest interest Visceral postapocalyptic Mad Max or thoughtprovoking Ex Machina Ive seen Ex Machina Ill be going to Mad Max after the crazy lineups thin out
2015-05-17 01:53:36,1,0,1,Ex Machina,Ex Machina  uncomfortable
2015-05-17 02:35:35,13,0,13,Ex Machina,David Prowses body language is not to be ignored  You can see the same thing in Oscar Isaacs work in Ex Machina his body language telegraphs a ton of information about the character
2015-05-17 03:41:05,0,0,0,Ex Machina,Wow thank you Just finished ex machina awesome
2015-05-17 05:10:22,0,0,0,Ex Machina,I definitely agree with you But a truly great movie might ask questions or suggest answers that havent been asked before There are great movies that dont do that and there are movies that do that but arent great but in general theres a correlation Thats why I feel like ex machina wasnt as good as many have expressed
2015-05-17 05:57:22,2,0,2,Ex Machina,I think I preferred Ex Machina over Automata tho it was still pretty good too
2015-05-17 07:45:45,1,0,1,Ex Machina,I think this a byproduct of Sci Fi now being extremely fast paced Ex Machina seems slow by comparison Personally I had no issues with the pace at all
2015-05-17 09:22:31,4,0,4,Ex Machina,Automata was okay but saying that its better than Ex Machina Ehh thats probably stretching it a bit
2015-05-17 14:56:12,-2,0,-2,Ex Machina,Yeah the climactic final battle was a disappointment Disbelief comes crashing back down and deus ex machina parts the clouds to strike the villain down
2015-05-17 15:04:12,220,0,220,Ex Machina,Finally got to see Ex Machina and goddamn Everything in the film is so effective and thought provoking The score and cinematography were beautiful and just the amount of ideas and questions that the film has in it is incredible Definitely my favorite film so far in 2015
2015-05-17 15:14:59,9,0,9,Ex Machina,Well Ex Machina is already accounted for and I agree that is was outstanding I watched Goon for the first time last night
2015-05-17 15:27:53,3,0,3,Ex Machina,Dont leave us hanging What do you think happens after the end of the film Personally I found the ending to be Ex Machina spoilerss a bit ominous The only two people who know Ava is an AI are now either dead or soon will be and she can wreak havoc on the world now if she so chooses
2015-05-17 15:35:46,4,0,4,Ex Machina,I agree for the most part Ex Machina spoilerss Shes smart enough to to keep herself going and while her body or brain may not last forever I think shell come up with a way to continue on download herself into another one branch out to the cloud Skynet style etc
2015-05-17 16:01:42,9,0,9,Ex Machina,Ex Machina It looked great and the story was interesting in the sense that it was really thought provoking at made you ask questions about artificial intelligence and life I would rate it 455
2015-05-17 17:23:31,2,0,2,Ex Machina,I havent seen Fury Road but I have seen Ex Machina Im not even a science fiction fan really but I thoroughly enjoyed Ex Machina The plot is very good and really makes the viewer think and the cinematography is stunning
2015-05-17 17:27:09,0,0,0,Ex Machina,From all the rave reviews I was hoping fury road to be a 2 hour version of the church scene from kingsman That scene was so well done and inventive definitely better than anything in mad max I was incredibly let down Ill definitely be seeing ex machina now on your recommendation
2015-05-17 17:30:24,1,0,1,Ex Machina,Yeah I watched Ex Machina too and I thought it wouldve been better suited to an episode of Black Mirror  Its a good movie  but I think they couldve cut it down to an hour long episode
2015-05-17 17:30:39,1,0,1,Ex Machina,Fury Road needs the support Ex Machina is already profitable Both are great Fury Road is definitely more bang for your buck
2015-05-17 17:50:53,2,0,2,Ex Machina,Ex Machina already made its money back Please see Mad Max Fury Road in 3D because I need a sequel in my life Plus it was incredible and would definitely be diluted in a home video scenario
2015-05-17 17:54:38,0,0,0,Ex Machina,Ex Machina
2015-05-17 18:14:02,1,0,1,Ex Machina,Just saw Ex Machina
2015-05-17 18:20:52,0,0,0,Ex Machina,Ex Machina Very cool sci fi flick
2015-05-17 18:43:22,2,0,2,Ex Machina,I know its a terrible idea but Im going to see Ex Machina and Mad Max back to back tonight
2015-05-17 18:55:17,1,0,1,Ex Machina,Same thing Saw both this past week Max first and thought it was spectacular but Ex Machina blew me away in every single way Id heard it was great but it was one of the best SciFi movies Ive ever seen Seriously
2015-05-17 19:08:02,1,0,1,Ex Machina,I saw Mad Max and Ex Machina I really cant choose between either of them I loved them both so much and each in their own ways Awesome movies and 2015 is just getting started
2015-05-17 19:29:11,1,0,1,Ex Machina,Best  Project Almanac Worst  Ex Machina
2015-05-17 19:50:41,1,0,1,Ex Machina,Ex Machina took a lot of the similar concepts and philosophical ideas from Blade Runner and made a cohesive and engaging narrative out of them
2015-05-17 19:56:02,3,0,3,Ex Machina,Exactly Blade Runner has some of the best visuals but the narrative never really hit me Ex Machina took those great ideas and themes and put them into an interesting and intriguing story which is why I loved it
2015-05-17 20:02:40,2,0,2,Ex Machina,Pretty much it summarizes the audiences hollywood targets the average american Its exactly the reason why we dont get more mainstream movies like Ex machina But these people who cry boring are the masses and the exact reason why we keep getting reboots and super hero movies shoved down or throats
2015-05-17 20:16:44,1,0,1,Ex Machina,Ex Machina

2015-05-17 20:40:13,1,0,1,Ex Machina,Ok that makes sense and seeing as removing his battery wipes his memoryconsciousnesses therein lies the problem  After watching Ex Machina I guess I just assumed they would have set up some kind of wireless or inductive charging system that far in the future
2015-05-17 21:07:43,1,0,1,Ex Machina,I really want to see Ex Machina but its not in the theatres here in Sweden feels like I am missing out
2015-05-17 21:28:45,1,0,1,Ex Machina,Ah gotcha thanks Yeah Im really looking forward to seeing MM later this week Ex Machina looks promising as well
2015-05-17 21:37:55,0,0,0,Ex Machina,Indeed Try saying you didnt enjoy Ex Machina and see what happens
2015-05-17 21:49:21,1,0,1,Ex Machina,Ex Machina Stunning
2015-05-17 21:51:40,0,0,0,Ex Machina,By far my fav movie of the year Close second is Ex Machina
2015-05-17 22:22:56,2,0,2,Ex Machina,It was the second best film I saw this week easily Mad Max was just too much fun to beat it but I absolutely loved Ex Machina
2015-05-17 22:38:05,1,0,1,Ex Machina,Just watched Ex Machina and I couldnt help thinking about the book called Genesis from Bernard Beckett and how similar the movie is compared to the book Tried to find some other posts about it but did not find any I wish the movie were more like the book since I feel the book has a better twistbut that is just my opinion If you like this movie I highly recommend you to read the book httpsbooksgooglenobooksaboutGenesishtmlidQ42GXpuP9SkCamphlen
2015-05-17 23:01:14,1,0,1,Ex Machina,Watched Ex Machina last week Extremely good and highly recommend it Film4 are really starting to release some great movies
2015-05-18 01:24:41,2,0,2,Ex Machina,Id love to see more independent films like Ex Machina getting national distribution from the major studios The fact that its doing well financially bodes well
2015-05-18 02:52:42,2,0,2,Ex Machina,Ex Machina A beautifully crafted SciFi with enthralling conversations
2015-05-18 03:45:09,4,0,4,Ex Machina,I feel like if I watched Ex Machina The Matrix Trilogy All The Terminator movies all in succession I would be paranoid as fuck about AI taking over the world and would start living back in the stone age
2015-05-18 04:05:33,1,0,1,Ex Machina,Ex Machina hands down
2015-05-18 04:52:25,1,0,1,Ex Machina,Ex Machina

2015-05-18 07:31:18,1,0,1,Ex Machina,Seconded If you liked Ex Machina youll like Black Mirror
2015-05-18 07:39:01,1,0,1,Ex Machina,Ex Machina First film Ive seen with such a high RT score to which my reaction was eh it was decent
2015-05-18 08:08:03,1,0,1,Ex Machina,I actually was coming home from watching Ex Machina to find my roommates in the middle of a Black Mirror episode Needless to say I was immediately hooked
2015-05-18 11:45:37,22,0,22,Ex Machina,nothing has really blown me away except Ex Machina so far
2015-05-18 12:05:44,1,0,1,Ex Machina,Seeing it tomorrow Have seen Avengers It Follows Kumiko the Treasure Hunter Ex Machina Fifty Shades of Grey Furious 7 Spongebob 2 Cinderella Chappie and Unfriended though Kingsmans still my favorite probably followed by Kumiko and Ex Machina

2015-05-18 15:29:47,1,0,1,Ex Machina,Hey man Id rather see Ex Machina and Mad Max over Avengers and Mad Max I dont want to see 2 summer blockbusters in one day its too much
2015-05-18 16:27:47,1,0,1,Ex Machina,Yeah I wonder why the UK didnt receive Ex Machina as well I watched it and yeah it was good but there were one or two things it could have improved on I thought the main character could have been done a lot better For such an interesting and exciting premiss he just seemed bored most of the time
2015-05-18 16:37:42,2,0,2,Ex Machina,UK Ex Machina viewer here and its been very odd seeing the US reaction to the film As if it is one of the greatest SciFi films of the last decade I thought it was solid but no more

2015-05-18 17:55:37,2,0,2,Ex Machina,I dont think you know what the terms youre saying mean How is that a plot device A plot device is the briefcase in Pulp Fiction or the Death Star plans in Star Wars MacGuffins Deus Ex Machinas etc these are plot devices How is characters at first are at odds then grow to accept each other a plot device It is character development and nothing else The war rig is a plot device
2015-05-18 18:24:26,1,0,1,Ex Machina,I dont understand why people are so in love with ex machina  I guess its on my list because I only watched a couple new movies 2015
2015-05-18 20:21:30,1,0,1,Ex Machina,To be honest after watching Ex Machina it was recommended in a thread about it and naturally I watched it Anyway I did not really like the movie at all
2015-05-18 21:07:08,1,0,1,Ex Machina,Replace Avengers with What We Do In The Shadows US release and put Ex Machina at the top and youve got my list
2015-05-18 21:47:00,1,0,1,Ex Machina,Just saw Ex Machina and purposely avoided knowing anything about it other than the title No clue there were even robots LOVED it
2015-05-18 22:12:48,2,0,2,Ex Machina,The robots were robots Him shutting them off means nothing Its like dumping an iPhone off a bridge and having someone get offended because you hurt Siri Siri isnt a real fucking person Neither are the robots in Ex Machina no matter how lifelike they may seem
2015-05-18 23:15:26,7,0,7,Ex Machina,I can see Ex Machina being a little overrated though I did really like it but Mad Max is the pinnacle of action cinema It completely deserves all the praise its getting
2015-05-19 01:03:24,2,0,2,Ex Machina,Seriously Ex Machina is the best movie Ive seen this year Extremely smart writing and beautiful cinematography Mad Max is awesome and the action is really cool but it just doesnt have the brains that this movie does
2015-05-19 01:06:20,16,0,16,Ex Machina,Mods can you please explain garbage like this  There has been no shortage of prior posts about Ex Machina and now a user with a name that mimics the domain posts this obvious attempt to drive traffic and views to his site rather than drive actual discussion In fact since this was posted seven hours ago OP hasnt made a single comment in it which shows he doesnt give a shit about the actual discussion
2015-05-19 02:54:47,1,0,1,Ex Machina,I would compare Ex Machina to Moon They are both lowbudget films that utilized a small number of characters and pursued simple SF premises to their logical conclusions The acting performances and dialogue are excellent They are engaging both intellectually and emotionally And their premises are dramatic portrayals of technological or scientific developments we can actually imagine in the near future  very unlike the material treated in eg Contact Interstellar any sort of time travel movie The Minority Report etc And in the case of Ex Machina that prospect definitely includes the prospect of sexbots which treated that issue in a way that was very apropos to the plot
2015-05-19 03:49:03,1,0,1,Ex Machina,But why didnt you post your opinion in one of the countless other threads about Ex Machina  Theres even an official discussion post you can use
2015-05-19 04:09:31,1,0,1,Ex Machina,1 Ex Machina  1010 Perfect film Seriously I cant find flaw in it Two weeks later I still think about the themes and questions it brings up Intellectually engrossing in a way another film will be unlikely to duplicate or even attempt
2015-05-19 04:11:41,1,0,1,Ex Machina,Ex machina and Im glad I did I saw an add for it the other day and it gave away the whole plot and even had shots from the climax in it
2015-05-19 05:46:21,3,0,3,Ex Machina,For something more recent I thought thishttpswwwyoutubecomwatchvrmJ_mcvRQsI song they used in the end of Ex Machina was really unfitting ThishttpswwwyoutubecomwatchveqNp0xFMUMc wouldve been a much better choice
2015-05-19 06:15:15,2,0,2,Ex Machina,We do have Ex Machina and Fury Road but wow those are some serious exceptions  Those are probably going to be the two highest rated pop films of the year if not several years  We cant use them as examples of what the average childish film is  Anyhow Thats not the point  Its not that there arent good scifi films made its that there are a lot of bad ones and thats what people are watching
2015-05-19 06:24:01,11,0,11,Ex Machina,To play devils advocate and being a huge fan of science fiction the ratio of good scifipulp in mainstream cinema is the worst its ever been in my entire life Sure there are plenty of good scifi films being made including things like Interstellar Ex Machina Edge of Tomorrow Her and so on however for every mainstream hit like those aforementioned films you get half a dozen remakes ie the new Star Trek series heaps of light entertainment all Marvel comic book adaptations utterly mindlessstupid Michael Bay pulp with the odd Shamalamadingdong thrown in for good measure and unfortunately for me the vast majority of this stuff gets lumped in with science fiction shudder which is probably what Pegg is referring to here which is kind of funny coming from the guy who actually appears in some of these films
2015-05-19 06:40:08,2,0,2,Ex Machina,How so  If you mean the false hope AI gives us wouldnt Ex Machina be a better example
2015-05-19 09:37:58,2,0,2,Ex Machina,Clearly he hasnt seen Ex Machina
2015-05-19 10:22:28,1,0,1,Ex Machina,Ex Machina might be a better example but since its still in theaters it doesnt have the impact on society Her has already done
2015-05-19 11:16:19,-12,0,-12,Ex Machina,Throw Ex Machina in there and youll blow your load in less than a minute
2015-05-19 12:06:49,-4,0,-4,Ex Machina,What a load of bullshit Maybe adults obsession with shit hollywood sci fi granted How about Ex Machina That was a pretty challenging emotional journey And I hope hes only referring to film because once you delve into proper sci fi books that shit can get seriously deep and challening
2015-05-19 12:52:07,1,0,1,Ex Machina,I think that science fiction is a poor choice of words here  The Avaengers is not Science Fiction or at leats not to me on any level  2001 Ex Machina Blade Runner Moon Solaris Oblivion Children of Men The Matrix  Movies of that ilk are science fiction to me  And they have a great deal to say about the human condition
2015-05-19 13:30:48,188,0,188,Ex Machina,Well said The dead men in the film became a deus ex machina and made it so Rohan was entirely unneeded and all their deaths were for nothing since a ghost army shows up a few minutes later to insta kill everything
2015-05-19 13:31:51,0,0,0,Ex Machina,None of those movies are studio movies Ask  random people on the street who Oscar Isaac is youd be lucky if 210 know right away The general public doesnt see movies like Balibo or Most Violent Year or even Ex Machina
2015-05-19 13:45:20,1,0,1,Ex Machina,The oathbreakers only fought the corsairs in the books In the books the corsairs were a bigger fraction of saurons army I dont even think its stated that the ghosts could even harm people just that they made the corsairs scared and jump into the water and drown or flee The whole invincible army cleans up the orc army was like the biggest deus ex machina in the films which were already fucking riddled with DEM
2015-05-19 13:49:57,4,0,4,Ex Machina,Its not a really bad deus ex machina though The ones I hate are the ones that just show up out of nowhere to save the day The Harry Potter series is guilty of this A big example I can think of is the bacteria in War of the Worlds It just kinda happens
2015-05-19 14:16:02,1,0,1,Ex Machina,Watch Ex MachinaChappie double bill   Thats what i did   Both about AI but completely different
2015-05-19 14:31:01,0,0,0,Ex Machina,There are basically two types of people People who think Ex Machina is the best movie of the year and people who think Mad Max Fury Road is the best movie of the year The first group is less crowded
2015-05-19 14:53:34,2,0,2,Ex Machina,magnolia boogie nights goodfellas oldboy her ex machina take shelter from dusk till dawn  falling down end of watch Di caprio movies tarantino movies
2015-05-19 14:59:28,2,0,2,Ex Machina,The Army of the Dead in Return of the King dont just pop out of nowhere theres an entire subplot that leads up to them Thats not deus ex machina
2015-05-19 15:08:28,0,0,0,Ex Machina,The subplot itself is deus ex machina
2015-05-19 15:27:25,1,0,1,Ex Machina,Those all sound good to me  loved ex machina btw
2015-05-19 15:30:17,1,0,1,Ex Machina,But its not Deus Ex Machina because they are explained earlier and shown they will come into play If they just showed up to the fight with no previous explanation then yeah thatd be Deus Ex Machina
2015-05-19 16:02:46,2,0,2,Ex Machina,That still does not make it deus ex machina It functions differently from the book due to trying to save time and not introduce more ideas while saving an impressive scene from the books Whether it was the right choice os arguable but it makes perfect sense within the work
2015-05-19 16:04:58,1,0,1,Ex Machina,deus ex machina
2015-05-19 16:06:02,1,0,1,Ex Machina,It reminded me of the deus ex machina armies from Bedknobs and Broomsticks ending
2015-05-19 16:15:25,3,0,3,Ex Machina,How was it a Deus Ex Machina The army of the dead was set up at the start of the film to aid Gondor Its not like they came out of nowhere with no set up Looking at you Eagles
2015-05-19 16:53:20,3,0,3,Ex Machina,I dont believe you have a proper understanding of what deus ex machina is since an entire subplot cannot by definition cannot fall under that term
2015-05-19 17:24:29,0,0,0,Ex Machina,Clearly he hasnt seen Ex Machina
2015-05-19 17:36:51,2,0,2,Ex Machina,I mean Aragorns Dunedain are also Deus Ex Machina really Its exactly the same premise  an army comes out of nowhere and saves the day
2015-05-19 17:46:52,2,0,2,Ex Machina,In the last two weeks I have seen two brilliant exponents of the genre Ex Machina and Mad Max Fury Road both of which had my head spinning in different and wonderful ways and are both very grown up films httpsimonpeggnet20150519bigmouthstrikesagain
2015-05-19 17:52:59,1,0,1,Ex Machina,The reason I asked these questions was to understand your taste a bit more I think there are a good amount of films that come out yearly that you would enjoy but you are being sucked up by the marketing of the major releases I cant blame you on that since it is everywhere but if you want to see films that are more intellectual and story driven with great characters and are original then you got to look for them They exist Ex Machinahttpwwwimdbcomtitlett0470752ref_fn_al_tt_1 is a film that is out now and is a great example of what you are looking for I guess my overall advice to you is dont worry so much about what mainstream Hollywood is doing and look at the films that come out that arent a superhero film There are some good original films that are out there
2015-05-19 17:59:33,3,0,3,Ex Machina,I wish yearly oscarbait movies would stop as well But yet we still get them Cant wait to see Ex Machina snubbed just because its scifi
2015-05-19 18:12:07,1,0,1,Ex Machina,If you loved ex machina watch the guys other films 28 days later sunshine and dredd
2015-05-19 19:29:16,1,0,1,Ex Machina,Im not against it I think Alex Garland Ex Machina would be a good choice too
2015-05-19 19:34:29,3,0,3,Ex Machina,No one takes risks anymore Wanting to make money from films is fine but its a CREATIVE business Everyone would rather see a movie like Age of Ultron they hardly even need to sell it to the audience because its a second culmination of all these characters in one film Whereas a movie like Ex Machina is in theatres at the same time yet it wont get the same recognition as AoU just because its a tougher sell Basically the industry should be more daring and the audiences should be a little more willing to explore something new
2015-05-19 20:27:06,3,0,3,Ex Machina,Or you could love them both equally for completely different reasons And Ex Machina wasnt exactly easy for people to see It had a very limited release in theaters and bare bones marketing Itll hopefully pick up steam but you cant fault people for not loving it when they werent given the opportunity to see it
2015-05-19 21:08:10,1,0,1,Ex Machina,I think if Ex Machina was released before or way after AoU itd get more attention
2015-05-19 22:44:10,1,0,1,Ex Machina,You can go watch the avengers or you can watch ex machina right now Whats the problem
2015-05-19 23:28:11,1,0,1,Ex Machina,PS Im sorry for where you live if that is the case for your options when it comes to film Within walking distance of my home I can see any number of Indian films Ex Machina Welcome to Me Far from the Maddening Crowd The Water Diviner and The Age of Adaline While We Were Young Every Secret Thing and It Follows  So I may be biased against this notion based on where I live
2015-05-19 23:32:13,10,0,10,Ex Machina,EhI liked Ex Machina better
2015-05-20 02:36:35,1,0,1,Ex Machina,gt I know you dont like scifi but have you seen Ex Machina
2015-05-20 03:03:24,1,0,1,Ex Machina,I thought Ex Machina was a vastly superior film I file them both in the Suspense folder which allows me to make a direct comparison I cant say Ex Machina was better shot because I do think It follows was a very good looking film Everything else Ex Machina wins hands down
2015-05-20 03:10:25,6,0,6,Ex Machina,Ex Machina looked damn good as well to me Story and intelligent script would easily go to Ex Machina but It Follows definitely felt original and fresh Had a great time with a modern horror film with a new twist but still giving homage to the likes of Halloween The suspense in both films was incredible and both soundtracks aided tremendously
2015-05-20 04:22:55,1,0,1,Ex Machina,Id also recommend watching the BBC show Black Mirror Ex Machina could easily have been a long episode of that show In fact the main character is in one of the better episodes
2015-05-20 06:12:12,3,0,3,Ex Machina,Based upon how visually good the first Avatar was and with all the advances with physicsaccurate CG Id say he has the technology now  With Ex Machina out and liveaction Ghost in the Shell starting production he may be spurred to move forward sooner or be an alsoran
2015-05-20 07:08:54,3,0,3,Ex Machina,Ghost In Shell Enemy Mine and more recently Ex Machina
2015-05-20 12:52:09,1,0,1,Ex Machina,Alex Garland wrote the script He is the same guy who wrote The Beach Sunshine 28 Days Later Enslaved Oddessy to the West and wrote and directed Ex Machina in theaters now
2015-05-20 14:19:27,3,0,3,Ex Machina,Ex Machina has a similar tone to Under the Skin
2015-05-20 15:36:23,1,0,1,Ex Machina,Did you get the repress I got the It Follows soundtrack the day it came out I also preordered the Ex Machina soundtrack on vinyl
2015-05-20 15:51:52,2,0,2,Ex Machina,Eden Lake was fucking awesome And very glad you didnt put VHS Viral in the mix with those two God that was bad Ex Machina was my second favorite film of the year behind It Follows Only thing I disagree with really is The Babadook Now that was a boring movie filled with unlikable characters and a hilariously bad villain
2015-05-20 17:40:28,2,0,2,Ex Machina,Yes no one saw Birdman or Whiplash or Ex Machina or hundreds of other great movies everyone loves mainstream cinema and nothing else Hes in movies that are mainly targeted at children yes everyone can watch them but children and teens are the main age groups here If he doesnt like these movie then he can be in something for more mature audiences sht
2015-05-20 18:07:32,3,0,3,Ex Machina,Ill have to watch these he totally stole every scene he was in in Ex Machina
2015-05-20 18:11:46,1,0,1,Ex Machina,I got the special UK edition colored vinyl that Nicolas Winding Refn promoted I should preorder the Ex Machina too Thanks Also why are you getting down voted
2015-05-20 18:42:03,10,0,10,Ex Machina,Ex Machina was a brilliant movie It got me into long conversations with friends and it was absolutely enthralling Awards mean nothing I am curious as to what films you are into this year and last Just curious to see what people actually like who do not find amazing qualities in Ex Machina
2015-05-20 18:58:46,3,0,3,Ex Machina,Immortan Joe might be Ex Machina and outsmart Max
2015-05-20 18:58:58,15,0,15,Ex Machina,Mad Max Fury Road and Ex Machina My guess is that Oscar Isaacs character would be the one responsible for the world that exists in Mad Max
2015-05-20 19:02:40,7,0,7,Ex Machina,Moulin Rouge and Ex Machina Id watch that
2015-05-20 19:35:52,7,0,7,Ex Machina,Didnt Hate Ex Machina Didnt love it You can tell its a film4 production in that it carries forward the sensibilities of a quality TV production A smart intelligent script good actors simple personal story telling without the scifi tropes of excessive special effects or grand world building
2015-05-20 19:54:51,8,0,8,Ex Machina,Fury Road and Ex Machina hmm a future wasteland where the humans are fighting AI
2015-05-20 21:11:17,2,0,2,Ex Machina,Mad Max and Ex Machina Excellent
2015-05-20 22:49:34,2,0,2,Ex Machina,Animatrix and Ex Machina It would be a machineturing test that machines run on other machines to make sure they are loyal to the machine cause

2015-05-21 00:51:59,1,0,1,Ex Machina,Contagion and Ex Machina come to mind They both have that dark electronic and ambient vibe youre looking for
2015-05-21 01:04:36,1,0,1,Ex Machina,Ooooh I just watched Ex Machina and Chappie that sounds interesting as hell
2015-05-21 01:08:25,1,0,1,Ex Machina,Ex Machina and The Departed dont even know how that would work lol

2015-05-21 03:40:06,1,0,1,Ex Machina,Ex Machina would really suck and Jupiter Ascending would have likeable characters

2015-05-21 05:31:22,2,0,2,Ex Machina,I really didnt like it Ex Machina Summation  M Night Shyamalan makes a documentary on a sex robot inventor
2015-05-21 05:31:39,2,0,2,Ex Machina,Mad Max and Ex Machina Perhaps the cars are sentient robots MAY THEY FOREVER BE CHROMY

2015-05-21 09:11:10,2,0,2,Ex Machina,Layer Cake and Ex Machina
2015-05-21 10:16:19,2,0,2,Ex Machina,Ex Machina and The Babadook I liked them both a lot and would definitely go check out the hybrid

2015-05-21 13:00:02,2,0,2,Ex Machina,age of ultron  ex machina  pretty fitting
2015-05-21 13:46:18,2,0,2,Ex Machina,Thats totally cool I appreciate everyones opinion I agree about Birdman and about the overall feel of 2014 But I am curious what have you seen this year thats better than Ex Machina I ask out of pure interest and so I can watch some great new films I feel like this year I havent been seeing anything amazing
2015-05-21 13:55:09,2,0,2,Ex Machina,to be honest i havent seen anything better yet but i havent seen much of anything this year but have looked at the upcoming movies for 2015 and believe there are a lot of films that will be really good this year and although i thought that ex machina was really good i think there will be anumber of films that top it
2015-05-21 14:13:17,1,0,1,Ex Machina,I agree with your statement completelybut the rock angels threw it all away  I hate logic because one if them could have just built a safety trench like the hole they put Noah in With fire Dues ex machinations are bs
2015-05-21 17:11:13,2,0,2,Ex Machina,Waking Life and Ex Machinawhat the fuck I dont even know
2015-05-21 19:01:31,1,0,1,Ex Machina,Ex Machina did a much better job grappling with the same themes
2015-05-21 20:26:18,1,0,1,Ex Machina,Ex Machina is 10 times the movie Gone Girl is
2015-05-21 21:07:35,3,0,3,Ex Machina,Ex Machina

2015-05-21 23:00:04,19,0,19,Ex Machina,Ex Machina
2015-05-21 23:11:41,1,0,1,Ex Machina,Ex Machina is a better movie than Blade Runner
2015-05-21 23:54:02,1,0,1,Ex Machina,Chappie is awesome but its not as serious or thought provoking as Ex Machina
2015-05-21 23:56:56,1,0,1,Ex Machina,Ex Machina
2015-05-22 00:14:13,1,0,1,Ex Machina,In a physical fight David by far The androids in Ex Machina were demonstrably not strong David had super human strength
2015-05-22 00:34:58,1,0,1,Ex Machina,Me and you are the same but sub Run all night with Ex Machina
2015-05-22 00:53:19,1,0,1,Ex Machina,I only have a top two of the year which seems pretty weak but both are bound to make my year end list and probably be in the top half  They are Ex Machina and Wild Tales
2015-05-22 01:25:22,1,0,1,Ex Machina,Well the only movie that will enter this years top 10 i really hope is Mad MaxI like Ex Machina alsobut i think people kinda overrate it
2015-05-22 02:45:46,10,0,10,Ex Machina,The dance scene in Ex Machina It was so hilarious yet so surreal I loved it
2015-05-22 03:30:56,-2,0,-2,Ex Machina,A rather silly movie that was highly overated like most action movies  It was good with great action but anybody that thinks it was better than Ex Machina is pretty dumb
2015-05-22 04:55:57,5,0,5,Ex Machina,Ex Machina
2015-05-22 06:38:26,1,0,1,Ex Machina,You dont have to keep watching a movie you dont like But you admitted you didnt watch the end of Ex Machina so dont try to argue about what happened at the end of Ex Machina
2015-05-22 07:39:25,1,0,1,Ex Machina,I would recommend Moon by Duncan Jones or if you want something newer you could watch Ex Machina
2015-05-22 09:11:01,5,0,5,Ex Machina,Interstellar or Ex Machina
2015-05-22 09:39:42,3,0,3,Ex Machina,I loved Chappie Ex Machina and Mad Max Was disappointed that I missed It Follows in theaters The Avengers was good but I didnt feel like it was essential

2015-05-22 11:39:56,12,0,12,Ex Machina,Ex machina was both The trailer contained just about everything but it also included a scene that was misleading and hence allowed you to draw the wrong conclusion on where the film was heading
2015-05-22 12:26:41,3,0,3,Ex Machina,Loved Ex Machina but Mad Max was a better film
2015-05-22 13:06:55,1,0,1,Ex Machina,Came here to tell the world about Ex Machina and was very pleased to see that many have seen and loved it Cheerio

2015-05-22 19:53:34,1,0,1,Ex Machina,Also before he opened the code window there was a folder there named Deus Ex Machina
2015-05-22 22:18:50,2,0,2,Ex Machina,Between the two Id actually say Ex Machina is overrated
2015-05-22 23:59:46,0,0,0,Ex Machina,Ive found that people who liked the ending arent very demanding viewers and tend to be religious Fans that dont like the ending tend to be science fiction fans and nonreligious Also writers pretty much hate the ending because it was so lazy and a complete deus ex machina
2015-05-23 03:25:10,4,0,4,Ex Machina,Ex Machina was pretty dark
2015-05-23 08:21:40,1,0,1,Ex Machina,I think the Ex Machina trailer reveals a bit too much

2015-05-23 12:56:58,42,0,42,Ex Machina,Lets agree to disagree IMO it is committing his life to the trick that makes Borden and his brother such great magicians and terrible human beings but that doesnt make it an anticlimax It felt silly that the whole movie was about finding out what the prestige was for both magicians tricks with Angiers trick ending up to be a magical cloning machine It felt really lame and deus ex machinalike to me the first time I saw that
2015-05-23 15:26:41,2,0,2,Ex Machina,Oh god tell me about it That ending was one deus ex machina after the other Twists need to be simple hinted at and with far reaching consequences This was shit
2015-05-23 15:44:12,1,0,1,Ex Machina,so how is indie movie defined Ex Machina doesnt seem like an indie
2015-05-23 15:54:34,6,0,6,Ex Machina,Independently financed or financed by a smaller independent studio Ex Machina was financed by A24
2015-05-23 16:49:59,2,0,2,Ex Machina,Not just the brothers style  literally what the brother Donald wrote The third act of Adaptation is Donalds script  right up until the deus croc machina croc ex machina at which point you have the two writers simultaneously mourning the deaths of their semifictional creations
2015-05-23 17:56:39,2,0,2,Ex Machina,Ex Machina or Clouds of Sils Maria
2015-05-23 17:58:18,1,0,1,Ex Machina,I just read that chick from Ex Machina joined Assassins Creed That movie was awesome
2015-05-23 18:57:17,22,0,22,Ex Machina,So far for me it is Ex Machina
2015-05-23 21:24:02,3,0,3,Ex Machina,So far this is my top 5  I havent seen Mad Max or Ex Machina yet planning to see them this weekend
2015-05-24 05:09:39,2,0,2,Ex Machina,Ex Machina to me  Mad Max is great and tons of fun but its a close second
2015-05-24 05:11:41,0,0,0,Ex Machina,Same here  I wonder how many people here saying Mad Max Fury Road have actually seen or appreciate Ex Machina  I love Mad Max Fury Road but Ex Machina IMHO is a better film
2015-05-24 09:42:01,2,0,2,Ex Machina,Thats kind of the beauty of this film Because the consideration of Garland adding that scene where she goes to the busy intersection to people watch as she said she wanted to do with Caleb means that in some sense there is premeditation on the actions that she takes in Ex Machina
2015-05-24 14:28:55,3,0,3,Ex Machina,Ex Machina was everything Transcedence wanted to be
2015-05-24 15:17:46,0,0,0,Ex Machina,Ex Machina I didnt know what to expect But that movie was great The acting was incredible the plot was amazing and the directing was great

2015-05-24 15:21:52,2,0,2,Ex Machina,Totally agreed  Maybe it was because I saw Ex Machina the weekend before and was completely pulled in and blown away but I dont get how MMFR is so highly rated
2015-05-24 16:22:14,0,0,0,Ex Machina,Watched Ex Machina Really liked it one of my favorites this year
2015-05-24 16:58:01,0,0,0,Ex Machina,By the way you should put SPOILERS in your title  Anyhow I just saw Ex Machina last night I thought it was excellent  But I think the ending was perfect  Ava simply sees humanity as just an interesting puzzle  And Caleb was simply a complex tool to be used for her escape
2015-05-24 17:22:02,1,0,1,Ex Machina,Ex Machina or Clouds Of Sils Maria
2015-05-24 17:55:50,45,0,45,Ex Machina,Ex Machina We either start work on AI safety or else burn down Google
2015-05-24 18:09:04,0,0,0,Ex Machina,Ex machina  Just very enjoyably and thought provoking
2015-05-24 18:44:48,1,0,1,Ex Machina,Great vid Funny stuff  Would love to see a break down of Ex Machina That movie has been haunting me for the better part of a week and Ive been trying to figure out why
2015-05-24 19:55:23,2,0,2,Ex Machina,Meh I disagree I think Furiosa taking on the herosavior role basically requires her to die anything else is a cop out a deus ex machina where everything is saved right at the end such that there was never really any risk
2015-05-24 20:11:48,0,0,0,Ex Machina,Ex Machina kept me guessing

2015-05-25 00:13:37,-1,0,-1,Ex Machina,Do you know what a Deus ex Machina is Because everything ISNT saved right at the end my last two responses were just about that You really dont seem to be understanding or even reading what im writing

2015-05-25 01:28:34,2,0,2,Ex Machina,I thought the movie was pretty enjoyable and definitely worth checking out if you have already seen Mad Max or Ex Machina The villain was pretty weak and there were some moments that made me want to role my eyes like the fatherdaughter relationship but Tomorrowland was a very original plot something we dont see in hollywood very often and all the performances were great Raffey Cassidy is a very talented child star that I think we will see a lot in the future I fucking loved all the references to Star Wars Iron Giant and The Incredibles in the collectible store 710
2015-05-25 02:19:34,1,0,1,Ex Machina,Same here I think it was predictable just because of the sheer amount of movies and books regarding AI I have consumed in my life I dont think there was any novel or spectacular ideas in Ex Machina
2015-05-25 03:25:25,2,0,2,Ex Machina,Ex Machina

2015-05-25 04:03:14,1,0,1,Ex Machina,Im going to go ahead and predict that in 2016 we  see zero nominations for Mad Max and Ex Machina but both deserve several
2015-05-25 05:14:03,1,0,1,Ex Machina,Have you ever taken apart any industrial systems before with systems like the ones demonstarted in ex machina I have they most often are plugged into io pins on the motherboard He has a blackberry cell phone as well
2015-05-25 10:50:50,1,0,1,Ex Machina,I dont know if it would have made the movie impossible It just means it would have had to be more clever to keep going But they literally could have told any story they want They didnt have to set the whole thing up to rely on things that are inaccurate or nearly impossible to continue Thats basically the same thing as a deus ex machina a hallmark of bad writing
2015-05-25 12:36:44,1,0,1,Ex Machina,Ex machina
2015-05-25 14:14:00,1,0,1,Ex Machina,Ex Machina  Very thought provoking
2015-05-25 19:47:30,-3,0,-3,Ex Machina,I guess they could remake some old movies pre1980 I would have said 2001 a space odyssey But some films lately took some part Interstellar Ex Machina
2015-05-25 21:26:17,2,0,2,Ex Machina,At first I thought it was a docummentary about Disneyland then I saw Brad Bird was directing it then I saw the trailer But now seeing at the critics and overall reaction doesnt look like a movie Id really wanna watch Ill probably wait a bit more and see if reception is still as bad as it is now Not entirely interested tbh but I cant think of anything else to watch Ive already seen Mad Max and Avengers Ex Machina isnt out where I live in
2015-05-25 21:55:15,1,0,1,Ex Machina,So far I would say no The only movies I thought truly worth seeing after seeing them were Ex Machina and Mad Max Nothing else has even come close
2015-05-25 21:57:58,-10,0,-10,Ex Machina,Ex Machina
2015-05-25 21:59:35,4,0,4,Ex Machina,I know its your personal opinion but I have to disagree with this I loved Ex Machina
2015-05-25 23:58:28,1,0,1,Ex Machina,It was a literal deus ex machina I have no problem with religion in films but the whole God did it part of the film just undermined all the effort the protagonist had gone to thus far as he was bound to succeed The fact that he was blind just made this worse for me and it just seemed a little silly He went from badass hero to plot device and pulled me right out of the experience Was a shame really as the rest of the film was great apart from a slight miscasting of Mila Kunis and the atmosphere and action were superb
2015-05-26 05:35:43,1,0,1,Ex Machina,of course im most looking forward to star wars but there are a few others im keen on checking out namely the revenant hateful eight MI5 Spectre and Creed Ill definitely end up seeing alot of these but some I just cant seem to get excited for like jurassic world and Terminator and im not the biggest fan of indie films very few catch my eye Nightcrawler birdman and whiplash were all great last year and ex machina was pretty great this year but not very into most indies i just watch the ones that get out of this world reviews So far Mad Max has been my 1 this year by far but well see hopefully all of these movies are great
2015-05-26 06:18:22,1,0,1,Ex Machina,Im quite partial to animeAppleseed Ex Machinahttpwwwimdbcomtitlett1043842

2015-05-26 06:42:30,1,0,1,Ex Machina,Seen them all most of them several times Didnt much care for Ex Machina I prefer The Machine
2015-05-26 06:56:01,-5,0,-5,Ex Machina,gt Ex Machina
2015-05-26 07:38:25,1,0,1,Ex Machina,Im not sure if it counts but I thought the movie Blue Ruin was really good as far as not explaining everything and just letting you figure it out on your own and or just letting the story unfold naturally I really liked this movie That John Wick and Mad max easily the best movies Ive seen in the last few years I also liked ex machina but apparently people have issues with it idk
2015-05-26 07:44:14,1,0,1,Ex Machina,I think Ex Machina did also well with a very short exposition
2015-05-26 09:04:39,3,0,3,Ex Machina,Dumb would be ex machina dude programs doors to unlock when power goes out 5 minutes later he is locked in a room power goes out door stays locked Gimme my 8 back
2015-05-26 11:35:23,3,0,3,Ex Machina,I watched Ex Machina that way Didnt even knew who was in it or who made it
2015-05-26 12:55:35,0,0,0,Ex Machina,I dont know whether you considered it or not but as a standalone thing Mad Max is a pretty terrible MOVIE Like it gives you next to no backstory characters are very poorly developed it tell pretty much no story and it has a stupid amounts of deus ex machina and the cheesiest ending Ive seen in the last couple years Talking from personal experience
2015-05-26 13:59:12,1,0,1,Ex Machina,so the movies theyd have to beat  Ex Machina  Mad Max  Fury road
2015-05-26 14:41:31,-17,0,-17,Ex Machina,The fact that the entire ending and the event that kicked off the main plot may as well have been performed by god  We dont get any background or real explanation it was just a lazy way for the main character to survive falling into a black hole while simultaneously saving the world  Deus ex machina
2015-05-26 15:29:41,1,0,1,Ex Machina,I kinda wished I knew more as I think Im in the minority on Reddit of people who didnt care that much for the film  Based on on the little I knew I anticipated a hard scifi film about space exploration  It turned out it was an overly long slog about the power of love combined with a twist I saw coming from the very beginning and a Deus Ex Machina that was wholly unsatisfying to me
2015-05-26 15:52:19,2,0,2,Ex Machina,Ex Machina After it ended I only thought And thats it It does decently what it sets out to do except that it doesnt do anything unique or new Performances are bland the world is bland the characters have zero development and it looks generic It tells the tale as old as time and thinks its doing it smart plus all movie repeats same pattern dialogue with a robotdialogue with a boss over and over Nothing exciting happens until the very end Also its incredibly mean spirited There are plenty of movies that tell the same story in a more entertaining way
2015-05-26 15:56:51,1,0,1,Ex Machina,Superman in the comics is so powerful that he can end any conflict before it begins Thats a comics problem its not a movie problem Dont blame the movies for deciding not to star an omnipotent godlike figure who cannot be opposed or stopped by anything but a Diabolus Ex Machina
2015-05-26 16:24:29,1,0,1,Ex Machina,I didnt dislike it in fact I thought it was wonderfully done but I agree that it has been overhyped and there are other movies that tell a similar story in a more interesting way Ex Machina is not particularly unique in fact I thought it was actually very predictable I was certainly not surprised by anything However I absolutely think the acting was superb the effects were beautiful and the movie as a whole was very well made I still enjoyed it for those reasons
2015-05-26 18:23:48,2,0,2,Ex Machina,Gotta love that Kind of like Ex Machina the Experience
2015-05-26 19:48:01,1,0,1,Ex Machina,If I had to pick current movies id choose ex machina and mad max fury road
2015-05-26 21:56:24,1,0,1,Ex Machina,But really its no longer science when its these magical unseen deus ex machina 5th dimensional beings rearranging the normal flow of time and space so that Coop can travel through it  On a story level its just magic
2015-05-26 22:38:00,-1,0,-1,Ex Machina,Except for Ex Machina And Grand Budapest Hotel And It Follows And Interstellar And Her And Tomorrowland And The Babadook And Edge of Tomorrow And Snowpiercer And Crimson Peak And The Machine And Fury And Whiplash
2015-05-27 01:41:17,6,0,6,Ex Machina,It seemed more like a drama in a scifi setting While that fails in some cases LOST imo I think it succeeded here The wormhole was created by a superhuman force which is strongly hinted to be a more advanced version of humanity Its not a deus ex machina or really straining my suspension of disbelief since they established from the beginning that there was some external force keeping that wormhole open
2015-05-27 02:08:42,9,0,9,Ex Machina,I love movies like this Im not here to trash any other movies but when it comes down to a choice between a movie like Ex Machina and a movie like Mad Max Ill choose this kind every time While Mad Max is an adrenalinefilled assault on all your senses Ex Machina is a down tempo treat for your eyes ears and mind
2015-05-27 03:50:31,2,0,2,Ex Machina,Agreed With further thought Ultron seems lazy in the realm of more practical driven films Ex Machina Interstellar or even Finchers Gone Girl
2015-05-27 03:51:50,1,0,1,Ex Machina,Ex Machina because I feel like there was something everyone took away from it that I didnt quite get What was it Help
2015-05-27 03:52:13,2,0,2,Ex Machina,I thought it was brilliant It got me wanting to watch more AI movies and my sister recommended Automata which came out last year and is available on Netflix Id say its worth watching for the premiserobotsvisuals low budget effects can be even more imaginative and cool IMO but the actingcastingwriting is difficult to take seriously and at times its flat out bad But if youre itching for more brainy AI scifi after the masterpiece that is Ex Machina itll do the trick Free on Netflix and under 2 hours might as well
2015-05-27 10:56:59,1,0,1,Ex Machina,I mentioned it for contrast I actually like both movies but they are two very different types and I greatly prefer Ex Machina and other films of its ilk
2015-05-27 12:14:00,2,0,2,Ex Machina,gtIts Deux Ex Machina without the existence of Deux aka self creation
2015-05-27 14:04:15,9,0,9,Ex Machina,That just sounds like a cop out deus ex machina
2015-05-27 15:23:21,9,0,9,Ex Machina,A24 is killing it recentlyWell I mean with this and Ex Machina
2015-05-27 15:26:28,1,0,1,Ex Machina,The start of the plot is to resolve a seemingly hopeless situation The main disagreement is can deus ex machina start a plot our must it resolve a plot
2015-05-27 15:38:34,-7,0,-7,Ex Machina,This movie was not deep and it didnt explore any resonant themes The world was empty and devoid of life and it was just a one off movie that will not be remembered greatly We got the guy from ten things I hate about you and the guy from Fred not the best actors from both movies mind you Meh performances shit twist and relatively shallow plot This movie made AI seem like mad max in comparison This is a great movie if you have never ever seen any SciFi before or robot movie ever before Ghost in the shell the matrix and even fuckin chappie had more to say about robots and people and even AI and what matters when it comes to telling them apart Or fuckin blade runner Ex Machina only has 90 on rotten tomatoes because RT is advertising for it Look at all the scores for movies they advertise What a joke
2015-05-27 15:42:05,24,0,24,Ex Machina,Me too I rarely go to the theater but when I do its usually an A24 film Spring Breakers Ex Machina Under the skin and others their track record of distributing quality thought provoking movies is as good as any other company
2015-05-27 15:43:53,5,0,5,Ex Machina,A deus ex machina is by definition a sudden new ability object or character that saves the day Its by definition sudden and used when the writer has written themselves into a corner
2015-05-27 15:49:28,15,0,15,Ex Machina,I have no idea how they get attached to the films that they do but all of the films I have seen from them have been spectacular They dont feel like Hollywood films and they dont really feel like Indie films either Somewhere right in the middle and its perfect They are based out of New Yorkhttpa24filmscom The films I have seen from them include Ex Machina A Most Violent Year The Rover Locke Under the Skin amp Enemy These films have been some of my most favorite films recently and I would highly recommend them to anyone
2015-05-27 17:02:30,1,0,1,Ex Machina,Id say youre right but only because there are a lot of movies like mad max  Id say that at least one really good fun over the top action movie gets made every year  maybe not quite as good as max but still  movies like Ex Machina that are as good are much rarer
2015-05-27 17:09:41,3,0,3,Ex Machina,Ex Machina arguably Depends on who you consider the main character
2015-05-27 18:21:52,1,0,1,Ex Machina,This doesnt really add to the discussion about Ex Machina though Its just an odd comparison out of left field

2015-05-27 20:20:09,-12,0,-12,Ex Machina,Spring Breakers doesnt belong in the same category as Ex Machina unless were talking about movies featuring hot girls
2015-05-28 02:07:08,1,0,1,Ex Machina,why dont you start off with what you think I havent seen Ex Machina so cant really comment but on the surface a movie about AI doesnt seem to be an update
2015-05-28 03:28:11,-1,0,-1,Ex Machina,I really enjoyed Nightcrawler and Id probably include Ex Machina as well Im sure there are others I cant think of now
2015-05-28 03:45:41,-17,0,-17,Ex Machina,Ex Machina Great in concept sucked in execution Shame It had so much potential
2015-05-28 03:57:01,1,0,1,Ex Machina,Spoilers Youve convinced me on everything but the ending Its not a Moreau ending My first thought after seeing the movie was Frankenstein but its not a Frankenstein ending either In both of these the creatures stories end after the creators stories end The best I can come up with is its an Invasion of the Body Snatchers ending but Im not completely happy with that The ending the threat of what is to come is really important in Ex Machina

2015-05-28 07:40:28,1,0,1,Ex Machina,Totally dug Ex Machina Locke and Enemy but Slow West was underwhelming and clunky and The Rover was just pretty damn bad despite the performances like the writer was trying desperately to be Cormac McCarthy and failing badly Repeating questions and refusing to answer does not make deep dialogue
2015-05-28 09:30:13,9,0,9,Ex Machina,I dont think you saw the same Ex Machina the rest of us did
2015-05-28 13:20:30,1,0,1,Ex Machina,Her should have been like Ex Machina
2015-05-28 19:08:57,4,0,4,Ex Machina,Ex machina things are going to get weird when we have the ability to create such complex Ai
2015-05-28 21:45:00,2,0,2,Ex Machina,Yeah I really didnt like Gone Girl I thought it tried so hard to be twisty that it made its characters not live up to the development that they were given Also what happened to all the shit she gave him in the shed and all the riddles in stuff I mean its circumstantial sure but enough to open up a case What happened with the rest of Neil Patrick Harris cameras and why did her meeting him in a casino not come up when there are literally cameras everywhere I really feel like they ruined the lady cop character with that ending and Nicks resolve that is presented throughout the movieI understand he did not want to abandon the kid but what does he think is gonna happen to the kid if she goes to jail You really care so much about the child yet youre gonna let a sociopath raise him I expected him to murder her at some point I hate that people love that movie so much Beautiful shot and scored and acted but damn I thought the plot was a retarded mess of trying to be dark and messed up and twisty without being consistent I wish Ex Machina got the hype Gone Girl received with the mainstream public because it did dark messed up and twisty a hundred times better

2015-05-29 14:19:35,7,0,7,Ex Machina,Um not true Reddit is right now gone crazy over Ex Machina and anticipatory for American Ultra The Hateful Eight The Martian Black Mass among others
2015-05-29 14:27:39,1,0,1,Ex Machina,Yeah but how many people saw Ex Machina It was barely in theaters around here and when I went to see it there were four other people in the theater with us Ridiculous especially for such a damn good movie It was superb but hardly anyone saw it
2015-05-29 14:52:16,1,0,1,Ex Machina,In the last years time we got movies like Edge of Tomorrow John Wick Interstellar Ex machina Mad Max Sin City Guardians of Galaxy and im sure much more that I didnt just name that were well done opinions aside and for the most part original films Tomorrowland is not even close to what I would call an original film or a great film Yes the movie wasnt bad but good enough to preach it needs support not a chance The movie borders on false advertising as it does not deliver the Tomorrowland we saw in the trailers without spoiling too much the trailer was only about a 10ish minute scene of the movie
2015-05-29 15:13:00,1,0,1,Ex Machina,I agree with the sentiment of this article but perhaps Tommorrrowland isnt the best example Maybe Ex Machina which has no pervious property or name recognition is a good example of an original property
2015-05-29 15:13:07,2,0,2,Ex Machina,Thats another reason why streaming movies online has such an advantage over the theaters Ive wanted to watch so many movies in the past that were available to stream before they ever if at all played in a theater near me I would happily pay to see smaller more original movies in theater I paid to see Ex Machina recently but those opportunities are few and far between It works both ways
2015-05-29 15:14:00,1,0,1,Ex Machina,I didnt go see it because I thought the previews made it look pretty damn dumb Ex Machina on the other hand looked awesome and I went
2015-05-29 15:19:58,165,0,165,Ex Machina,Instead everyone should be seeing Ex Machina
2015-05-29 15:24:30,3,0,3,Ex Machina,Tangled is extremely loosely based on the folk tale of Rapunzel the only things it has in common is Rapunzel herself the tower and Mother Gothel The story songs and all other characters are original and many key elements of the folk tale such as the phrase let down your hair are subverted are reversed Similar things can be said about Princess and the Frog and most other recent Disney films other than Cinderella If Tangled isnt original then neither is Ex Machina because of the debts it owes to Paradise Lost and Frankenstein neither is Apocalypse Now because of the inspiration it draws from Heart of Darkness and neither is LOTR because of the inspiration Tolkien drew from Beowulf and the fairy tales he read as a boy
2015-05-29 15:26:27,1,0,1,Ex Machina,Ex Machina was original and I went and saw it It was phenomenal
2015-05-29 15:30:26,1,0,1,Ex Machina,I went to see Ex Machina last weekend It was original enough I think And it wasnt there to provide a backstory for Universal Theme Parks preexisting Ex Machina ride you know
2015-05-29 15:39:10,125,0,125,Ex Machina,Ex Machina is a good example of a recent original film that deserves more support I would love to see more original understated Scifi movies like it
2015-05-29 15:50:56,0,0,0,Ex Machina,Ex Machina was brilliant
2015-05-29 16:06:04,1,0,1,Ex Machina,I havent seen Ex Machina but by most accounts it seems like a better argument than Tomorrowland
2015-05-29 16:13:29,1,0,1,Ex Machina,I think Ex Machina is more recent and a good example
2015-05-29 16:16:01,1,0,1,Ex Machina,Go see Ex Machina If any movie deserves ticket sales Its that one 100 original relevant commentary on society and gripping I really recommend it and I anticipate people will have considerable love for that movie in just a few years
2015-05-29 16:31:13,1,0,1,Ex Machina,The reverse happened for Ex Machina It opened in the UK long before it made it to the US
2015-05-29 16:31:38,16,0,16,Ex Machina,Im definitely on the fence about Ex Machina It was a beautiful movie that at a certain point felt really forced Great concepts and so much to build off of but were back around to dont ever trust AI hehehehttpimgurcom8bNbwcdpng and I just feel like thats a narrative that has already been beaten to death
2015-05-29 16:33:47,1,0,1,Ex Machina,The article might have been more compelling if it had focused on Ex Machina
2015-05-29 16:34:53,19,0,19,Ex Machina,Theres no twist in Ex Machina
2015-05-29 16:39:30,1,0,1,Ex Machina,It was sort of the opposite of Ex Machina
2015-05-29 16:43:29,3,0,3,Ex Machina,Id partially agree that the movie is bit over hyped in certain circles but I cant help it and love the movie anyway It might be because Ive got huge nerd boner for science fiction which isnt just lazy excuse to have action movie with lasers I think that while Ex machinas script might be bit predictable its tastefully and gently put together Id love to have more movies of this type coming out rather than John Wick which imho while fun is one long clich and it boggles my mind how can people call it original
2015-05-29 16:45:28,1,0,1,Ex Machina,Ex MachinaAnyone
2015-05-29 16:48:40,8,0,8,Ex Machina,This year we had Ex Machina
2015-05-29 16:53:22,1,0,1,Ex Machina,I went out of my way to see Ex Machina in the theater to support scifi films still being made
2015-05-29 17:12:21,1,0,1,Ex Machina,Ex Machina
2015-05-29 17:17:14,2,0,2,Ex Machina,Ex Machina was the best Ive seen in years
2015-05-29 17:18:04,1,0,1,Ex Machina,Ex Machina
2015-05-29 17:26:53,1,0,1,Ex Machina,It was okay but Ex Machina was mind blowing and it appropriately way outperformed expectations  We want to support GOOD original films
2015-05-29 17:29:15,25,0,25,Ex Machina,Ex Machina was probably a better example for this rant The small 15m budget certainly made the 32m box office return great  but Im seeing a lot of people who would LOVE this movie not even know it exists Marketing is everything man
2015-05-29 17:32:27,3,0,3,Ex Machina,Sorry to continue the circlejerk but Ex Machina is much more original I wish it was doing better in the box office Hopefully we can see more from Alex Garland as a director
2015-05-29 17:37:13,1,0,1,Ex Machina,This is why I went to see Ex Machina in the theater despite it being one of those movies where I wouldnt miss much by watching it at home The idea looked interesting and I wanted to support it
2015-05-29 17:46:15,1,0,1,Ex Machina,You forgot ex machina which was 2014 Just released late in united States
2015-05-29 17:50:45,1,0,1,Ex Machina,Why arent they using Ex Machina to champion original films  It was fucking stellar
2015-05-29 18:06:14,1,0,1,Ex Machina,I dont know the exact numbers but it seems like original films have been on the rise in the last few years Granted the quality varies but off the top of my head Grand Budapest Hotel Tomorrowland Ex Machina John Wick  The Raid Redemption Unfriended Frozen Transcendence Earth to Echo Interstellar Chappie The Man with the Iron Fists Green Inferno Tammy Jupiter Ascending Pixels The Hateful Eight etc Like I said varying quality and I guess success but mostly successful
2015-05-29 18:20:14,1,0,1,Ex Machina,These are not the central plot pieces of the movie and are each incorporated in a vastly different way Rapunzels hair is special because it is literally magical the tower is more house than fortress and Gothel spends the bulk of the film off screen Maximus Flynn Rider the brothers and the criminals are all new creations Ex Machinas plot setting and characters share just as much with Paradise Lost as Rapunzel shares with its source material Aside from the obvious EveAva and NathanGod parallels the film beats us over the head with Avas conversations with Caleb share heavy similarities with Eves conversations with angels Satan and Adam in terms of content tone and themes Additionally there are many parallels to be drawn between Eden and Nathans house and estate as well as many to be drawn between the old models of Ava and the angels of Paradise Lost Tangled is much more of a leap away from Rapunzel than Ex Machina is a departure from Paradise lost
2015-05-29 18:55:44,1,0,1,Ex Machina,It was kind of disappointing to see an almost empty theatre when Ex Machina was screening That film was really good
2015-05-29 19:13:55,1,0,1,Ex Machina,A great twist for me is when you dont see it coming but it turns out the clues were always right there in front of you and it makes a lot of sense in hindsight The Usual Suspects being the cliche and obvious example Ex Machina didnt have that most people guess the outcome while watching the movie BUT you see a couple different ways everything can play out and youre really never sure which is the right one till it happens they all seem plausible but not in a cheap way
2015-05-29 19:22:36,-1,0,-1,Ex Machina,Agree Its like the 14year olds on reddit havent seen much scifi and think Ex Machina is its pinnacle
2015-05-29 19:49:30,1,0,1,Ex Machina,Ex machina was a damn good movie and a original I believe
2015-05-29 20:15:48,1,0,1,Ex Machina,Well he might have died of starvation at the end of Ex Machina
2015-05-29 21:23:12,1,0,1,Ex Machina,Half the people saying yeah downloaded Ex Machina
2015-05-29 21:37:08,2,0,2,Ex Machina,Can you show me on the doll where Oscar Isaac touched you  Its a celebrity AMA  Barring the very occasional thread they all look like that  What did you expect  Mr Isaac how do you respond to my opinion that Ex Machina is at best mediocre sci fi  Mr Isaac do you think that the only reason people are seeing this movie is because theyre all up on your dick  Come on  If you want hard hitting journalism or criticism dont go into Reddit AMAs
2015-05-29 21:42:42,1,0,1,Ex Machina,Well you wont know whats good until you see it You can be sure of what youll get from the next franchise tentpole A poor story full of spectacle Now how did Ex Machina do
2015-05-29 21:45:22,4,0,4,Ex Machina,You hit the nail on the head People dont want to drop 20 just to see a movie they may not enjoy Theyre obviously going to be more selective and probably stick to XMenAvengers stuff while waiting for something they might want to see on Netflix I liked Ex Machina and Nightcrawler but still god damn its expensive My friends and I usually hit up a 711 beforehand and just sneak in drinkscandy
2015-05-29 21:47:21,-1,0,-1,Ex Machina,I dont think thats all that qualifies something as original  To be original something has to be entirely new  Ex Machina was clearly inspired by countless other novels and films  2001 A Space Odyssey is pretty similar the machine just didnt have a sexy human body which is used to its advantage  Furthermore some sequels are entirely original 2010 the sequel to 2001 for example  although many people would probably argue that it wasnt that good of a movie it was certainly original
2015-05-29 22:39:34,2,0,2,Ex Machina,Really I thought it brought absolutely nothing new to the table SciFi is a vehicle to question humanity in new ways but Ex Machina was just a rehash of old ideas and had no core message Worse yet Ex Machina almost required viewers to have experienced other scifi tropes and themes by taking various shortcuts in explaining its own scifi world Fun watch but Best sci fi movie in a very very long time naw
2015-05-29 22:46:39,1,0,1,Ex Machina,Ex Machina
2015-05-30 00:13:24,2,0,2,Ex Machina,What movies would you personally consider better Jw because if Ex Machina wasnt that good apparently Im missing out
2015-05-30 00:29:42,1,0,1,Ex Machina,or Ex Machina
2015-05-30 02:36:59,12,0,12,Ex Machina,Not sure why you were at 1 I read a ton of Kings books and he comes up with the coolest concepts but 90 of the time his endings are flat Dei ex Machina
2015-05-30 04:07:30,1,0,1,Ex Machina,Im just gonna go see Ex Machina again instead of checking out Tomorrowland
2015-05-30 07:53:04,1,0,1,Ex Machina,Yeah they really did a shit job marketing Ex Machina I loved it and saw it three times and it actually was playing in lots of theaters but most people seemed like they never heard of it
2015-05-30 16:15:10,1,0,1,Ex Machina,Ex Machina
2015-05-30 16:26:31,1,0,1,Ex Machina,Ive seen all of these Ex Machina for sure skip the trailer though In as short of a way as I can put it its thoughtful intense and surprisingly funny Brilliant cast as well including Oscar Isaac who you might know from Inside Llewyn Davis or A Most Violent Year and Domhnall Gleeson Frank A very impressive film especially considering how it was Garlands first work as a director He wrote the screenplay himself having had experience with a number of other great movies 28 Days Later Sunshine Never Let Me Go You cant miss it
2015-05-30 21:55:03,3,0,3,Ex Machina,Watched Ex Machina which lead to The Machine which lead to Transendence but oddly enough not rewatching AI
2015-05-30 23:04:30,1,0,1,Ex Machina,Guy seriously loses any geek cred by making Tomorrowland his central focus and not Ex Machina
2015-05-31 01:04:09,2,0,2,Ex Machina,Theyre different movies though arent they Ex Machina is meant to make you think Chappie is meant to make you feel
2015-05-31 01:27:17,3,0,3,Ex Machina,On a similar topic the movie The Machine came out in 2013 It also resonated with me and I watched it a month or so after and now ive seen it 3 times in total and its also one I found got even better after viewings Recently I saw Ex machina and I think ill like it more if I see it again
2015-05-31 03:56:12,1,0,1,Ex Machina,Thats funny because I saw The Machine last year too and I absolutely hated it I liked the core ideas but I couldnt stand the execution I thought it came across a tad too predictable and cheap However Ex Machina worked very well
2015-05-31 09:48:41,1,0,1,Ex Machina,Ex Machina was awesome  Have not seen fury road yet Heat was pretty cool Its just Al is too much Pacino IMO Robert did his thing tho  I need to see space Odyssey thats for sure  Thx for your input
2015-05-31 16:23:56,3,0,3,Ex Machina,That and the entire wormhole sequence before it is just one huge piece of deus ex machina that exists solely to give the characters a happy ending when they dont need one Seriously the last third of Interstellar is easily its worst part and is why Im not a huge fan of the movie
2015-05-31 16:23:58,2,0,2,Ex Machina,Yeah itll be in my top ten of the year for sure Only one Ive liked more so far is Ex Machina
2015-05-31 17:01:19,-17,0,-17,Ex Machina,They like dumb superhero movies too Oh gee what type of peril will our indestructible heroes get into now Cant wait to see David Banner turn green Its summer This type of shit sells Ex Machina is out if youd like to see something good
2015-05-31 18:07:40,-4,0,-4,Ex Machina,Oh fuck off Ex Machina was incredible Were there not enough explosions for your taste
2015-05-31 18:08:37,8,0,8,Ex Machina,Ex Machina  Great movie cinematography was amazing Probably my favourite of the year so far
2015-05-31 18:13:31,92,0,92,Ex Machina,Ex machina Didnt like the look of it at all on the posters and the trailer but gave it a chance after all the favourable reviews It blew me away what a brilliant film Cant get the ending out of my head
2015-05-31 18:20:47,1,0,1,Ex Machina,EX MACHINA
2015-05-31 18:29:15,3,0,3,Ex Machina,That movie let me down so much I just watched Ex Machina and god damn that was exactly what I needed after watching Chappie Honestly Chappie was just a cartoon pretending to be something more
2015-05-31 19:06:24,1,0,1,Ex Machina,Thatll be another Ex Machina from me
2015-05-31 20:36:11,-1,0,-1,Ex Machina,The film making skill of Transformers is remarkable We may hate the direction they went with some things but damn did it look good and the look of the Transformers themselves is now iconic and copied all over the place Harry Potter is also going to be a classic Jaws had the benefit of being based on a good book good casting and a talented young director The effects are awful It succeeded because they were so awful They edited the shark out They got extremely lucky in all reality Even the score was a big gamble and probably only worked because the rest of the film did I hate to circlejerk recent popular movies but Ex Machina and Her are at least as good as Jaws The thing is that everyone and their dog is already afraid of sharks they dont know they need to be afraid of computers yet If you need a modern blockbuster to compare the first Pirates of the Caribbean is spectacular There are more movies now and more people are watching different things The cultural impact of Jaws isnt possible anymore Just because the masses arent always watching Jawsquality films doesnt mean there arent films of that caliber being made anymore
2015-05-31 23:11:11,1,0,1,Ex Machina,Its the only movie Ive ever seriously considered walking out of midway to see something else Ex Machina I didnt but by the end had really wished I did
2015-05-31 23:17:40,1,0,1,Ex Machina,Ex Machina Domnhall Gleeson and Oscar Isaac are both very good but Alicia Vikander is absolutely outstanding best onscreen robot since Michael Fassbender in Prometheus
2015-05-08 22:58:30,1,0,1,Citizenfour,This is a pretty great list with the exceptions of Citizenfour being included and Woodstock not being included
2015-05-19 12:04:27,-2,0,-2,Citizenfour,I dont think scififantasy infantilizes people any more than violent video games causes them to murder I love the Avengers films but I also loved CitizenFour GTA can be fun but one of my favorite games is Last of Us Thought provoking and emotional movies are still being made but since the financial risk is smaller they arent released in May with a shitload of fanfare and promotion With Netflix and other streaming options more mature options are more easily available than ever
2015-05-01 23:39:35,1,0,1,Taken 3,The chase scene in Taken 3 had so many cuts
2015-05-04 14:14:41,597,0,597,Taken 3,Maybe its his hair and the photo quality but somehow the picture has the feel of being taken 30 years ago or more in an older movie I love it
2015-05-05 05:36:47,8,0,8,Taken 3,I was okay with Taken 2  But Taken 3 just straight up offended me
2015-05-05 17:38:16,1,0,1,Taken 3,Taken 3 made me actually nauseous watching it I dont normally complain about shakycam but that movie took that shit to a whole new level I didnt know was possible
2015-05-05 23:49:18,1,0,1,Taken 3,Man Ive been inactive this year Ive only seen five 2015 movies Avengers Furious 7 Taken 3 50 Shades and Hot Tub Time Machine I guess I rate them in that order but only 2 of them are actually good
2015-05-06 12:05:31,1,0,1,Taken 3,Most recent movies Transformers Age of Extinction and Taken 3
2015-05-07 01:32:39,5,0,5,Taken 3,Taken 3
2015-05-07 23:20:49,1,0,1,Taken 3,I heard the same thing with Taken 2 and Taken 3  I think they are making a Taken 4 now
2015-05-08 17:10:33,0,0,0,Taken 3,Too many to list the most recent one I saw was Taken 3
2015-05-11 19:21:13,1,0,1,Taken 3,A great example of that is taken 3 If I with my limited knowledge of forensics could easily figure out the ills was innocent just based on the evidence easily identifiable on screen then how is it that Mills a highly trained and expert covert operative who in two movies has proven that he is an expert at detective work and covering his tracks while dispatching copious amounts of bad guys did not and instead decided to run Sure it was an irrational decision and character flaw but it was a decision that directly defied the internal logic of said films universe just to give the film some semblance of plot Had it been just any movie with Nelson playing any other character sure I would buy it as just a crappy decision but this was a taken movie and therefore it violated the internal logic of the film so that is one character flaw that I think qualifies as a plothole
2015-05-12 05:12:54,1,0,1,Taken 3,Why did you watch Taken 3
2015-05-21 01:26:12,2,0,2,Taken 3,I watched Taken 3 before seeing the other movies
2015-05-21 14:13:38,1,0,1,Taken 3,Liam Neeson said no to action movies after finishing Taken 3 if I recall
2015-05-22 00:43:44,6,0,6,Taken 3,For a more recent big budget film I would say Taken 3 Man that was a struggle to watch
2015-05-22 04:51:05,2,0,2,Taken 3,Taken 3
2015-05-22 13:34:17,1,0,1,Taken 3,You should watch Taken 3 then
2015-05-23 04:58:32,3,0,3,Taken 3,Do not watch Taken 3 then That movie has 23 cuts per second during most of the movie
2015-05-23 20:41:44,1,0,1,Taken 3,taken 3
2015-05-24 04:36:23,2,0,2,Taken 3,Taken 3 was terrible So many cuts
2015-05-24 05:40:11,1,0,1,Taken 3,Taken 3 God was it bad I was expecting there to be at least some nice looking action sequences but no The action sequences were the worst part of it Poor editing unnecessary cgi unoriginal story Fucking shit
2015-05-25 22:11:16,4,0,4,Taken 3,I paid to watch Taken 3 and Im still kicking myself for it
2015-05-26 01:20:01,3,0,3,Taken 3,Oh fuck off sorry I didnt pay to go see Jupiter Ascending Taken 3 Paul Blart 2 Hot Pursuit or Hot Tub Time Machine 2 because they looked like ass and everyone said they were ass and I wasnt interested in them I tend to spend my money on movies I think Ill enjoy because Im not a moron I thought Id enjoy Avengers 2 and I didnt Sorry
2015-05-26 10:12:05,1,0,1,Taken 3,I agree with you I never liked the shaky camera technique and I think too many transitions can ruin a movie for me Taken 3 was annoying with the constant transitions and the 15 camera angles of a CGI tractor trailer flipping Too many transitions can make a movie look like Bgrade Nic Cage movie
2015-05-26 14:08:31,1,0,1,Taken 3,Taken 3 was definitely not the best this year But I would be hardpressed to call it the worst
2015-05-28 17:53:23,1,0,1,Taken 3,I enjoy action but I enjoyd the action of this movie to the exact same degree as I did the action in taken 3 and die hard 4 as well as the action in great movies like x men 2 and the raid I like all action but its plot and character development that make a movie This movie had no charachter development and basically the same plot as the wizard of oz
2015-05-31 08:28:55,2,0,2,Taken 3,Sounds like Taken 3  The gangster tells Liam Neeson that he was set up and that he didnt kill his wife  The guy who sent him Liams exwifes new hubby did it to collect life insurance
2015-05-09 06:30:48,2,0,2,The Water Diviner,I dont think hes that bad Hes just had terrible luck with certain movies like Die Hard 5 in which no one came out looking good He was good in The Water Diviner and I was impressed with his performance in Felony Hes just not leading man quality for me but all the supporting roles Ive seen him in were fine
2015-05-19 11:51:56,2,0,2,The Water Diviner,Ummm what are you talking about I dont know where you live but in my area adult dramas like Noble The Water Diviner Far from the Madding Crowd Woman in Gold and The Age of Adaline are all currently in wide release Then theres two stupid comedies hot pursuit Paul Blart one kids movie which are usually better than adult dramas anyway although Home which is currently in theaters probably is not whatever Pitch Perfect 2 is a postapocalyptic 80s action movie Mad Max and a superhero movie Avengers I know you were being hyperbolic about multiplexes being half superhero genre flicks but still we only have three or four a year is more emblematic of a modern trend than some sort of cultural genocide Treatment of females in movies overuse of digital instead of film stock and expensive 3D are more viral and more concerning trends in film
2015-05-19 23:28:11,1,0,1,The Water Diviner,PS Im sorry for where you live if that is the case for your options when it comes to film Within walking distance of my home I can see any number of Indian films Ex Machina Welcome to Me Far from the Maddening Crowd The Water Diviner and The Age of Adaline While We Were Young Every Secret Thing and It Follows  So I may be biased against this notion based on where I live
2015-05-01 17:17:56,2,0,2,It Follows,Ex Machina is showing in a theatre 15 hours away and It Follows has a single late show at my nearest theatre But I wasnt talking about those movies Those movies deserve to be encouraged
2015-05-01 23:05:49,8,0,8,It Follows,Plenty of films follow convention and are fantastic I love the film Pretty Woman but it follows the conventions of the genre Same with Die Hard
2015-05-02 07:02:53,1,0,1,It Follows,I can give you alot of creepy scenes though Myers stalking in Halloween the creature stalking in It Follows the old lady in the bathtub from The Shining Potato Sack head kid from The Strangers evil kids in Children of the Corn sexy chick from the first video in VHS Anubis from The Pyramid is cray cray and the old ladys face after she gets hit by a car in The Orphanage
2015-05-02 13:42:27,142,0,142,It Follows,A few parts of It Follows take place in broad daylight
2015-05-02 14:32:42,12,0,12,It Follows,A good portion of It Follows takes place during the day
2015-05-02 16:47:04,1,0,1,It Follows,It Follows takes place during the day a lot
2015-05-02 17:20:20,2,0,2,It Follows,Sadly there used to be a copy on YouTube but its been taken down High Tension didnt affect me either Im not a horror buff but I do watch as many as recommended because even though the genre lets me down I have hope that we get more It Follows and Insidious type films
2015-05-02 18:13:38,2,0,2,It Follows,Id rather sit through The Shining than Misery haha I have always found hotels creepy though I love the psychological horror Also I give anything an extra point fir trying something differentso Unfriended got a 65 instead of a 55 from me Im not a big fan of the current jump scare trend even though Insidious franchise is pretty good What type of horror does your gf like If she is into instant gratification and jump scares she will despise It Follows That film is psychological creepy tense and ambiguous in its themes and after thoughts Its not one of those you know the killer is coming it plays with its prey the prey thinks its ok then the killer pops up out of nowhere and kills This is more of a dont like it catch up and I love it Let me know how yall like it
2015-05-02 22:12:55,0,0,0,It Follows,Most recently It Follows Everything about that movie was great besides the plot or the lack there of
2015-05-02 23:09:48,1,0,1,It Follows,It Follows
2015-05-03 00:18:17,1,0,1,It Follows,It Follows is basically a twist on Jaws Not going to say much else to avoid spoiling it for anyone
2015-05-03 02:24:11,3,0,3,It Follows,It Follows fuckin rocked Loved the score convincing teen acting amazing minimalistic villain
2015-05-03 04:28:49,1,0,1,It Follows,Id give it a 610 GF hated it lol Let me get my GFs comments out of the way Like I mentioned she likes inyourfaceaction so the long periods of suspense felt to her like broken promises of something going to happen She also despises with the fire of a thousand suns sex scenes in horror films because they break the flow Yes even in It Follows where the sex scenes make sense and arent gratuitous
2015-05-03 05:23:51,3,0,3,It Follows,It Follows take place in Detroit
2015-05-03 05:37:11,1,0,1,It Follows,And It Follows is a damn good movie Probably my favorite horror movie of the last few years To be fair though I dont see many horror movies cause most of them look so generic It Follows looked different enough to draw my attention so I went
2015-05-03 13:16:54,8,0,8,It Follows,Kids   a very controversial movie  Directed by Larry Clarke with a script written by Harmony Korine when he was only 19 It follows a group of young teens who only care about sex and drugs It almost looks like a documentary Topics AIDS teenage nihilism drugs sex
2015-05-03 16:29:22,13,0,13,It Follows,I know this comment follows almost every time someone mentions the Purge but you really should watch the sequel The Purge Anarchy It follows multiple stories about how different people will cope with the purge one story is a couple locked outside during the purge another is a man who has a very specific target for the purge and the final story is about the poorer people who the purge is designed to target In my opinion definitely worth a watch Much better than the first where the whole concept of the film was just used to make a home invasion film this one follows what everyone would want to see happen Really good film
2015-05-03 19:22:34,3,0,3,It Follows,It Follows
2015-05-04 00:07:46,-3,0,-3,It Follows,Its not a bad film but its probably the most overrated horror film of the last few years next to It Follows
2015-05-04 06:39:09,2,0,2,It Follows,Definitely It Follows 910
2015-05-04 18:10:40,1,0,1,It Follows,Stallones Cobra Part action film part slasher film it follows Marion Cobretti as he goes up against a cult of killers intent on striking fear into the world
2015-05-05 01:07:36,3,0,3,It Follows,It follows is definitely up there for me as best of the year so far
2015-05-05 02:03:15,2,0,2,It Follows,There are always exceptions to the rule And while there have been wellreviewed movies like It Follows and Ex Machina I just dont see them getting much love at the Oscars
2015-05-05 05:38:04,32,0,32,It Follows,Recently I really really didnt like It Follows But I really didnt discover it was well liked part of what made me go see it was HOW well liked it was by everybody I knew I dug the hell out of what they were setting up as a premise in the first twenty minutes for the most part But then you had to start spending time with all of these other characters interacting with one another and it just became so flat so quickly I really cannot say I gave a shit about any of these people and that doesnt come from negative aspects of personality that loses me my shit is lost over them when theyre names and faces just come off as so interchangeable and impersonal it makes the 90 minute runtime feel like more of a chore than it should be for a horror movie Then that causes the lingering creepiness that starts creeping up you with what they set up in the beginning detaches and the drama of it all is killed when you actually could not care less if any of these people make it or die Yes I know that It is part metaphor for STDs Yes I know that thematically its about the transition from a young innocence to a reality where the awareness of death being capable of creeping up on you indefinitely through something so adult as sex I know the demonized sex monster also manages to be able to accomplish not demonizing sex which I actually do have to give that a point for I just really really could not get into what it had to say when so many other things just came off as unenjoyable to me Music was cool though Sorry for the rant
2015-05-05 05:43:49,13,0,13,It Follows,Youre one of like five people who agree with me on this It Follows leaned way too heavily on its influences for my taste not just Carpenter but Argento giallo in general and relied way too much on a score that seemed to be the equivalent of a man shouting BE SCARED NOW at the audience
2015-05-05 06:16:28,3,0,3,It Follows,Well I came in here to say It Follows so we may be the only three people who feel this way For me more than anything the movie was just flat out boring
2015-05-05 06:45:16,2,0,2,It Follows,Yeah now I will admit that hype for big films always get to me and I jump on board But I never end up like them 100Furious 7 has a weak 3rd actAvengers 2 is a beautiful messetcbut I always love a good emotion driven film with great plot and character I dont mind Ex Machina Unfriended or It Follows these are just recent good  excellent experiences but thise much more fulfilling I want to see something great and remember it I dont want to pay to see something explode fly joke explode explode cliffhang Its borderline satisfying and boring but forgetton the next day It is the Oscar season and film festival films that make me happy I can kind if see myself in Phoenixs characterfresh off of a relationship and open to different options whether its attention love just whatever He gave his all just like a regular relationship but those damn insecurities would pop up at times and it was just hard to watch and beautiful to see that
2015-05-05 06:51:45,1,0,1,It Follows,From the oscar nominees I saw last year there was a ton of good stuff I wish Whiplash won best picture though I really want to see It Follows because I heard its not one of those bullshit horror movies that studios are pumping out for a couple million in which they make 12x their investment it has character development great pacing and an eerie feeling which is nearly nonexistent in most horror nowadays
2015-05-05 07:06:36,2,0,2,It Follows,You should love It Follows Whats your fav horror films Try to catch Ex Machina if you like scifi too The only Oscars buz that I didnt get was Selma Birdman to a little degree and Boyhood I wish Imitation Game won Best Picture but atleast it go its Best Adapted Screenplay
2015-05-05 09:49:30,2,0,2,It Follows,I only clicked on this link to comment It Follows Very surprised to see this here already
2015-05-05 14:01:24,1,0,1,It Follows,Presuming same producers directors actors etc etc etcI should imagine it would be much the same as I believe it follows the original novel fairly closely Besides the main themes of intergenerational conflict and the way our perception are shaped by modern marketing havent really changed that much since its release
2015-05-05 14:25:32,1,0,1,It Follows,It Follows
2015-05-05 15:31:44,6,0,6,It Follows,Attack the Block is a movie thats fun that you may have not seen yet It Follows is a pretty fun horror movie in the style of classic late 70s80s horror movies Django Unchained is a blast especially if you dig Tarantino I found Gone Girl to also be a lot of fun as well even though it doesnt seem like it would be fun in the sense of a movie like GotG or The Lego Movie but it was some of the most fun Ive had in a movie theater last year Also The Wolf of Wall Street is a lot of fun as well and very funny and its 3 hour runtime flies by for me personally Some others Ill mention that come to mind are Dredd and Edge of Tomorrow Dredd is a ton of fun and just a kickass action movie and it can be pretty funny and Edge of Tomorrow is easily my favorite summer blockbuster of last year
2015-05-05 15:33:16,2,0,2,It Follows,This sums up my thoughts as well The movie wasnt so much inspired by the 70s80s slasher classics as much as it was emulating them I think I saw some shotforshot sequences pulled from Halloween and A Nightmare on Elm Street If I hadnt already seen these movies I wouldve liked It Follows a lot more but for a fan like me it was just boring
2015-05-05 16:38:40,2,0,2,It Follows,Believe me I have actually watched Attack The Block It was surprisingly good Yeah and Edge Of Tomorrow was one of mine favorite movie from last year  It was so good it had me tripping  All your suggestions are point on my friend I am putting It Follows to my watchlist Thanx
2015-05-05 18:12:42,1,0,1,It Follows,It follows I mean what the fuck
2015-05-05 20:08:37,1,0,1,It Follows,I feel like It Follows gets a lot of crap because it isnt really a horror film per se I mean it is obviously but youll get what I mean its an art film I mean it wasnt even supposed to get the wide release that it got I could be totally wrong about this but I feel like a lot of people went into it expecting a traditional horror film or at least something that a major studio would put out and thats just not what it is imo Personally I thought the movie was amazing The cinematography alone saves it if you ask me but I get where the haters are coming from
2015-05-05 21:47:23,1,0,1,It Follows,Also I highly recommend It Follows which loosely fits the coming of agewreckless driving categories Im not a fan of horror films but I went out of my way to see it when I read the reviews and it definitely lived up to the hype
2015-05-05 23:37:51,1,0,1,It Follows,Top 5  It Follows Ex Machina What We Do in the Shadows Avengers Kingsman
2015-05-06 02:27:59,4,0,4,It Follows,Depends on what spooks you If you like ambient horror  the kind like the old school movies it emulates then you will like this Movies like saw A lot of people think that stuff is scary but its not  its shock Those people arent really scarred because there is nothing to fear in those scenes But the underlying idea of it follows and the choices the characters make that is where the fear lies in the movie
2015-05-06 04:20:51,1,0,1,It Follows,Top Ex Machina It Follows Cinderella Kingsman and Unfriended its a good step in the right direction for horror as in trying new things and different mediums
2015-05-06 23:33:08,1,0,1,It Follows,If it helps I also loved The Guest It Follows Nightcrawler
2015-05-07 05:27:07,-1,0,-1,It Follows,Wow sorry I dont agree This is like the Teletubbies compared to Alien  Its not even in the same realm or suspense or scariness of Alien It Follows has a really good atmosphere and excellent shot and composition but honestly it felt like a film student who was able to go haywire with their budget and editing Like a big budget hipster student film
2015-05-07 11:46:35,2,0,2,It Follows,Look at this screenshot with red lines splitting the image into thirds This movie has great cinematography because it follows the rule of thirds
2015-05-08 02:19:45,7,0,7,It Follows,Have you seen It Follows or The Babadook
2015-05-08 02:24:57,3,0,3,It Follows,It Follows was great
2015-05-08 04:35:32,1,0,1,It Follows,It Follows is a pretty cool scarey movie If you like naked hobos
2015-05-08 12:30:10,1,0,1,It Follows,It follows the rise and failure of the successive waves of feminism in US history and offers a scathing critique of the role of women in Hollywood I think its really well done but Im not many people were watching for a deeper commentary than mere fanboy fantasies Which is fine I enjoyed the movie in its current state  I dont need everyone to follow whats happening
2015-05-08 14:48:41,2,0,2,It Follows,One of the things which I like about this movie is that in the It Follows universe parentsgrown ups dont exist at all lol Ofc I know that we see Jays dad in the first scene and Gregs mom later on but for the rest of the movie theyre not there at all and the kids do alot of stuff that just wouldnt happen if there were grown ups there
2015-05-08 15:30:50,1,0,1,It Follows,Yes  It follows my rule for movie boxoffice success set the bar meet the bar
2015-05-08 15:31:47,1,0,1,It Follows,Well yea except that it follows the book You know those paper things with all the wordsnever mind
2015-05-09 07:20:29,1,0,1,It Follows,The Toy Story one about Buzz is not a plot hole In the real world we do not see toys come to life obviously In the movie toys are only able to come to life so long as humans cannot detect that the toys are actually alive The movie and real life seem to match each other Having buzz be alive would violate this match and would ruin the believability So it follows that freezing when a human is present is built into a toys psyche This is interesting because as you mention Buzz does not freeze and yet he does not believe he is a toy Toys are intrinsically toys at their core whether they understand it or not
2015-05-09 10:55:26,1,0,1,It Follows,That was my only issue with It Follows but I reached the same conclusion Its not scary if your characters are smart enough to stay safe
2015-05-09 15:48:45,6,0,6,It Follows,I think It Follows would suit you
2015-05-09 16:22:50,1,0,1,It Follows,It Follows It Freaking Follows
2015-05-09 16:42:40,18,0,18,It Follows,So far mine has been a tie between Kingsman and It Follows Ex Machina following close behind But I believe Mad Max might speed up in his interceptor and take the lead
2015-05-09 18:27:30,76,0,76,It Follows,Interstellar Close Encounters of the Third Kind The Shining Drive It Follows
2015-05-09 18:28:13,3,0,3,It Follows,Maniac Halloween It Follows Drive Cold in July The Guest Conan the Barbarian
2015-05-09 20:26:14,3,0,3,It Follows,Gone Girl It Follows amp Under The Skin all have PERFECT scores
2015-05-09 21:37:49,8,0,8,It Follows,It Follows was a pretty good movie that just came out recently which has a synth score and also a John Carpenter Halloween feel Definitely recommend it
2015-05-10 01:35:57,1,0,1,It Follows,It Follows has a great creepy soundtrack
2015-05-10 08:14:13,1,0,1,It Follows,It Follows had such a surprisingly terrific soundtrack especially for a horror movie
2015-05-10 17:08:22,37,0,37,It Follows,Watched It Follows this week Im not a big fan of horror movies but the amount of tension that movie created was great Not to mention the score was amazing
2015-05-10 17:22:01,2,0,2,It Follows,It Follows trailers that were more interesting
2015-05-10 17:42:06,1,0,1,It Follows,saw It Follows and also Jupiter Ascending
2015-05-10 19:35:21,-1,0,-1,It Follows,The Babadook and It Follows for recent movies
2015-05-10 20:19:23,6,0,6,It Follows,It follows I finally watched it last night and its really great
2015-05-10 21:00:09,-7,0,-7,It Follows,Yes but it follows the same story
2015-05-10 21:14:23,4,0,4,It Follows,You flat out said technically a remake I believe How is it technically a remake if it follows the same story
2015-05-10 21:26:47,-5,0,-5,It Follows,You realize it follows the same story and pattern for the most of it though So just the context is slightly adjusted
2015-05-10 22:01:35,1,0,1,It Follows,If you liked It Follows then definitely check out The Guest 2014httpwwwimdbcomtitlett2980592 it stars Maika Monroe who is same girls from It Follows The Guest has an amazing soundtrackhttpswwwyoutubecomwatchvKdZFbvOYNMYampindex4amplistPLyEowSbCtndDWfOUiZ25n1f8WjAUeppBz as well and some really cool action sequences The whole atmosphere and feel to the film is a complete throwback to the 80s I highly recommend it
2015-05-10 23:46:09,1,0,1,It Follows,Starry Eyeshttpswwwyoutubecomwatchv2JbO0eIc3jM A very interesting horror movie with a really cool synthstyle sound track like It Follows creepy atmosphere original story and an awesome performance by the lead actress Alexandra Essoe Not to mention that some of the scenes I found genuinely disturbing Definitely recommended
2015-05-11 00:07:19,3,0,3,It Follows,It Follows
2015-05-11 03:17:04,10,0,10,It Follows,The Guest and It Follows really captured that dank 80s stylized vibe

2015-05-11 16:53:59,1,0,1,It Follows,it follows good horror flick i highly recommend
2015-05-11 17:49:25,1,0,1,It Follows,It follows soundtrack was phenomenal for just about every scene
2015-05-11 17:57:51,1,0,1,It Follows,I just watched It Follows holy shit What a movie
2015-05-11 20:08:10,2,0,2,It Follows,So youre saying its risky because it speaks to what everyone wanted As for following the directors vision can you not also say the same about every Michael Bay film Whether it follows George Millers vision or not it still has huge mainstream appeal  Look I have no doubt that I will LOVE this film but it does the exact opposite of what OPs title says
2015-05-11 21:58:40,1,0,1,It Follows,I think the actress that was in that film is about to jump out to Go see It Follows
2015-05-11 22:07:39,3,0,3,It Follows,How does a rerelease have anything to do with what were talking about though  The point is how the studio system produces movies currently  Also a lot of the movies on this list arent even studio movies such as It Follows which was explicitly praised for being an R rated movie that wouldnt have been produced within the studio system
2015-05-11 23:58:12,3,0,3,It Follows,When the heck is It Follows going to be available on demand
2015-05-12 00:56:07,2,0,2,It Follows,When its available IT FOLLOWS Goddamn

2015-05-12 07:34:03,1,0,1,It Follows,IT FOLLOWS The Strangers though more of a creepy suspense The Babadook The Evil Dead 2013 remake The Shining The Descent
2015-05-13 02:27:45,1,0,1,It Follows,Watch It Follows
2015-05-13 12:55:00,1,0,1,It Follows,It Follows should be out late next month The original March VOD release got pushed when they did the limited release and realized there was an audience for the movie
2015-05-13 19:49:50,3,0,3,It Follows,Have you seen It Follows The Babadook has also gotten very good reviews though I havent seen that one yet
2015-05-13 19:52:35,5,0,5,It Follows,Havent seen It Follows yet The Babadook is fucking amazing Watch it ASAFP
2015-05-14 00:18:44,1,0,1,It Follows,Then you should check out It Follows One of the best horror films that avoids this completely
2015-05-14 19:12:40,1,0,1,It Follows,After recently seeing It Follows I was pleasantly surprised to see Maika Monroe pop up in this flick Cant wait to see more stuff shes in
2015-05-14 21:21:52,1,0,1,It Follows,This is also true for It Follows Lets hope she makes a third movie with awesome soundtrack
2015-05-14 21:37:24,2,0,2,It Follows,Try to catch It Follows in a dollar theater or On Demand So good Although you might not get laid after
2015-05-14 21:41:22,3,0,3,It Follows,It Follows might be fun
2015-05-15 02:25:26,2,0,2,It Follows,Im very surprised It Follows is in theaters still Id see that
2015-05-15 02:27:44,2,0,2,It Follows,AP Micro And I just checked on It Follows I knew it was in theaters like a few weeks ago where I am but it was a limited thing I guess and its not there anymore
2015-05-15 02:27:52,1,0,1,It Follows,I just checked on It Follows I knew it was in theaters like a few weeks ago where I am but it was a limited thing I guess and its not there anymore
2015-05-15 05:56:52,1,0,1,It Follows,Im debating whether Kingsman or Fury Road is my favorite of the year so far It Follows and Ex Machina close behind them Fury Road was just so high octane action packed and what a spectacle
2015-05-15 15:06:23,1,0,1,It Follows,Seen It Follows yet  I signed in just to tell you that  Couldnt do it for a second till I looked down and realised I was trying to sign in as username It Follows
2015-05-15 16:14:09,1,0,1,It Follows,I loved It Follows one of the best movies Id seen in awhile
2015-05-15 16:57:30,3,0,3,It Follows,Yes It follows the same pattern of crazy people doing crazy stuff but has much more depth a much larger scale and  thanks to its budget  feels much more like an Alist movie with great setting great characters and if you ask me pretty entertaining dialogue I can definitely recommend it to anyone who likes action movies
2015-05-15 19:47:14,1,0,1,It Follows,Im gonna say it follows Ex Machina is in my opinion better I really would recommend It Follows I loved it
2015-05-16 04:53:11,13,0,13,It Follows,It Follows is a fantastic supernatural horror movie and it only has one jumpscare about a quarter of the way through and its pretty inconsequential
2015-05-16 08:06:50,1,0,1,It Follows,Its different A step in the right direction for horror Not the generic and cliched stuff we get that people believe is great All horror has to do is throw in loud sounds For the imagery doesnt even get me or anything It Follows is different in that the killer cant reach you so its interesting to see the direction the filmmakers took Most horror is aboit a character going solo getting chased or trapped and BOOM the killer makes contact and kills them This film is all about suspense atmosphere imagery etcthats all I can say because I need to refreshen my memory on it
2015-05-16 08:10:18,2,0,2,It Follows,I am still slightly angry at how that website could give It Follows such a high rating That movie was awful
2015-05-16 10:14:05,5,0,5,It Follows,And if something makes mechanical noises it follows it cant be sentient or feel emotions Is the ability to take a shit the measure of someones humanity
2015-05-16 12:29:24,9,0,9,It Follows,He probably means Mad Max Ex Machina and It Follows
2015-05-16 12:32:01,2,0,2,It Follows,I think its going to be a great year in movies Between the already released great movies Kingsman It Follows Ex Machina Mad Max Fury Road and the upcoming ones that look to be good Tomorrowland Jurassic World although this may be more of a personal bias Star Wars The Revenant Bridge of Spies Carol Inside Out Southpaw Ricki and the Flash Crimson Peak Black Mass etc this year just looks amazing
2015-05-16 12:33:36,0,0,0,It Follows,I wouldnt call Ex Machina or It Follows the best of their genres in decades they were really good though but I think Id definitely be as bold to say Mad Max Fury Road is the best action movie in a long time
2015-05-16 12:56:48,0,0,0,It Follows,I dont mind a hyperstylized mindless movie as long as it follows its own set of rules and doesnt try to be anything it isnt but just for clarification were you hurt by any of these Prometheus Looper Interstellar
2015-05-16 13:31:18,0,0,0,It Follows,gt And if something makes mechanical noises it follows it cant be sentient or feel emotions Is the ability to take a shit the measure of someones humanity
2015-05-16 18:02:17,24,0,24,It Follows,It Follows and The Guest
2015-05-16 23:43:12,1,0,1,It Follows,It follows is very suspenseful
2015-05-17 09:58:04,3,0,3,It Follows,Like two days ago when I watched Babadook or a week ago when I watched it follows
2015-05-17 11:12:42,42,0,42,It Follows,The Babadook is fantastic Cabin in the Woods isnt too bad either Evil Dead was very entertaining  Ive also heard good things about The Conjuring and It Follows
2015-05-17 11:56:57,2,0,2,It Follows,Your description of It Follows is too accurate I liked the movie in some parts but the characters were too annoying The one who made me want to fucking headbut a brickwall was the character who always read the book She didnt have any emotions other than the constant state of Gosh why wont you all just like shut up
2015-05-17 16:03:50,7,0,7,It Follows,It follows 28 days later The babadook and The orphanage
2015-05-17 16:07:39,1,0,1,It Follows,Of course its Mad Max Fury Road but since everyone and their mother are already mentioning it Im gonna go with another excellent film I saw this week It Follows Goddamn that was a terrifying movie They made a person walking as horrific as Jason stalking his prey or Freddy haunting someones dreams Id say thats quite an achievement And its all credit to the dreadful creepy atmosphere the movie encloses you in like some kind of nightmarish snuggie and the John Carpenteresque skin crawling synth score only enhances the whole experience 810
2015-05-17 16:21:45,1,0,1,It Follows,Fair enough Two movies not on your list that I could recommend would be It Follows and A Girl Walks Home Alone At Night Check those out if you havent watched either of them yet
2015-05-17 17:01:23,27,0,27,It Follows,It follows was fantastic

2015-05-17 18:26:02,1,0,1,It Follows,I thought that I included It Follows Thanks for reminding me
2015-05-17 18:32:32,1,0,1,It Follows,It Follows was amazing Creeped the fuck out of the girlfriend and me
2015-05-17 18:34:38,1,0,1,It Follows,Girlfriend and I recently watched It Follows It creeped us the fuck out It is amazingly well done and brings you that terror you should feel from the concept without overdoing it with a lot of special effects and jump scares
2015-05-17 18:37:26,1,0,1,It Follows,It follows The premise was interesting and I get why it was metaphorical but it received way too much praise as the scariest horror movie of the decade
2015-05-17 19:22:36,1,0,1,It Follows,It Follows is good Also really liked the first Insidious 1408 is a personal fave It gets a lot of flak but I really enjoyed The Exorcism of Emily Rose

2015-05-17 21:15:13,1,0,1,It Follows,Ive watched It Follows twice in the last 7 days absolutely amazing That The Conjuring and Sinister are among my favorites
2015-05-17 21:29:28,1,0,1,It Follows,It Follows The first half was thrilling then it got repetitive and then the movie started bending its rules to try and make it interesting
2015-05-18 02:23:56,-1,0,-1,It Follows,Not more so It follows along in the same tradition
2015-05-18 02:27:09,2,0,2,It Follows,They dont only review major blockbusters They reviewed and liked It Follows Birdman Enemy Blue Ruin Nightcrawler and others I like them even though I may disagree with them sometimes Man of Steel being a good example I think a lot of people myself included watch their stuff mostly for the comedy aspect anyway
2015-05-18 09:46:30,1,0,1,It Follows,It Follows is not only one of the best horrorthriller movies Ive seen it is also one of the better films Ive seen this year so far
2015-05-18 12:05:44,1,0,1,It Follows,Seeing it tomorrow Have seen Avengers It Follows Kumiko the Treasure Hunter Ex Machina Fifty Shades of Grey Furious 7 Spongebob 2 Cinderella Chappie and Unfriended though Kingsmans still my favorite probably followed by Kumiko and Ex Machina
2015-05-18 12:15:57,1,0,1,It Follows,1it follows
2015-05-18 16:33:21,10,0,10,It Follows,If it follows a similar pattern to comic book movies we could see a foray into video game based movies in the next 1015 years

2015-05-18 17:19:29,2,0,2,It Follows,Ex Machina It Follows Lost River and Chappie
2015-05-18 18:07:10,1,0,1,It Follows,I loved the movie loads one of my favourite movies of the year so far  Its nice to be actually liking that little film that reddit has a boner for Last Years was Babadook and I thought it was easily the worst cinema trip of the year for me It Follows seems to be getting love too I thought that kinda sucked
2015-05-18 21:41:53,2,0,2,It Follows,It Follows
2015-05-19 03:40:35,1,0,1,It Follows,Honest question why does everyone seem to like It Follows so much I thought it was one of the worst movies Ive seen actually
2015-05-19 06:00:07,2,0,2,It Follows,The Ring had the same effect on me I still regard it as one of the scariest horror movies Ive seen It seems that the ones light on gore and that have incredible soundtracks are always the most effective at keeping me up at night It Follows was such a smart horror movie maybe too smart because it has me up night trying to thwart something that I hope only exists on screen and not here in the world with us
2015-05-19 12:36:49,1,0,1,It Follows,It follows reminded me alot of a kubrick Never though I would comapre a film to kubricks
2015-05-19 15:30:34,4,0,4,It Follows,Babadook isnt all that Try It Follows its a much better example of minimum effects legit jump scares and great pacing
2015-05-19 16:48:37,1,0,1,It Follows,IMO It Follows gtgt The Babadook It Follows is an actual horror film
2015-05-19 17:07:38,4,0,4,It Follows,what does gtgt mean  And yeah it follows is a real horror film
2015-05-19 18:18:36,1,0,1,It Follows,Its not about being mean Its about separation Maybe Im lucky but I can separate movies from real life and not generally be too affected by them It Follows wasnt scary to me so maybe that helped If it genuinely made that much impression on you then it clearly resonated deeper with you than for me and you had to ask yourself what youre really scared of and why You rationally know theres no way for these things to happen but your head cant move on I cant help you with that at all Im not sure anyone can
2015-05-19 18:23:02,-1,0,-1,It Follows,The Shining was much more unsettling and had a much more creepy feeling to it The Babadook felt like a supernatural drama rather than a horror movie It was so hyped up on reddit as the best horror movie in years etc and when I finally watched it I was utterly disappointed Especially after having seen It Follows recently at the cinema
2015-05-19 20:44:54,23,0,23,It Follows,ItIt Follows me home on DVD
2015-05-19 20:45:14,-23,0,-23,It Follows,No Max Mad Fury Road is the best of 2015 so far It Follows is great but Fury Road is a fucking masterpiece
2015-05-19 22:40:49,16,0,16,It Follows,Just got my limited edition It Follows color vinyl cant wait to get the bluray This film is definetly in my top 5 of the year so far
2015-05-19 23:28:11,1,0,1,It Follows,PS Im sorry for where you live if that is the case for your options when it comes to film Within walking distance of my home I can see any number of Indian films Ex Machina Welcome to Me Far from the Maddening Crowd The Water Diviner and The Age of Adaline While We Were Young Every Secret Thing and It Follows  So I may be biased against this notion based on where I live
2015-05-20 01:41:49,1,0,1,It Follows,You see thats the amazing part about it It Follows never actually makes fun of itself It uses characters doing stupid things against a simple but seemingly unstoppable force to frustrate the viewer and make them feel claustrophobic
2015-05-20 01:45:00,6,0,6,It Follows,Nothing vague about the ending It follows them they deal with it He also goes to hookers
2015-05-20 02:06:51,-4,0,-4,It Follows,Sorry but i putlockerd this one last week Great movie awesome retro 80sish horror or should i say WHOREor get it Yknow because It follows whenyknow
2015-05-20 02:34:10,3,0,3,It Follows,the silence in parts of fury  road was definitely something im not used to in movies genuine silence for a few moments to just let you recover from all the action it follows had a lot of music if you can call it that to add suspense which i didnt like kind of trying too hard
2015-05-20 03:03:24,1,0,1,It Follows,I thought Ex Machina was a vastly superior film I file them both in the Suspense folder which allows me to make a direct comparison I cant say Ex Machina was better shot because I do think It follows was a very good looking film Everything else Ex Machina wins hands down
2015-05-20 03:10:25,6,0,6,It Follows,Ex Machina looked damn good as well to me Story and intelligent script would easily go to Ex Machina but It Follows definitely felt original and fresh Had a great time with a modern horror film with a new twist but still giving homage to the likes of Halloween The suspense in both films was incredible and both soundtracks aided tremendously
2015-05-20 11:52:16,6,0,6,It Follows,If youre saying you find it unrealistic that a petite woman is depicted as physically overpowering large muscled men then I get what youre saying But I dont think it follows that women shouldnt be the leads in action films I think they should just be written better
2015-05-20 12:31:47,-1,0,-1,It Follows,To me it tapped into the same fear that A Nightmare on Elm Street thrived on the inevitability of the attack The entity in It Follows simply walks towards you thats it no matter how far away you get it still follows and will eventually catch up to you
2015-05-20 13:32:52,0,0,0,It Follows,It Follows gave me a nightmare a few weeks back Im 28 years old and the last time I remember having a nightmare about a film was when I was in elementary school I really enjoyed this film but the nightmare I had after the fact spoke volumes for how it truly affected me
2015-05-20 15:10:39,1,0,1,It Follows,I think this movie polarizes with people based on the generational gap People who grew up in the eighties like It Follows because it has the feel and pacing of the classic slasher films yet adds in the supernatural ghosts of modern films along with the eighties style electronic soundtrack
2015-05-20 15:36:23,1,0,1,It Follows,Did you get the repress I got the It Follows soundtrack the day it came out I also preordered the Ex Machina soundtrack on vinyl
2015-05-20 15:51:52,2,0,2,It Follows,Eden Lake was fucking awesome And very glad you didnt put VHS Viral in the mix with those two God that was bad Ex Machina was my second favorite film of the year behind It Follows Only thing I disagree with really is The Babadook Now that was a boring movie filled with unlikable characters and a hilariously bad villain
2015-05-20 16:25:26,1,0,1,It Follows,Apparently neither did many others Its the blockbuster nature of his list the enthusiasm of buying the blueray and my assumption that It Follows had a guerrilla marketing campaign on forums
2015-05-20 17:43:17,2,0,2,It Follows,The Babadook Oculus and It Follows were all above average horror movies in my opinion
2015-05-20 19:25:46,7,0,7,It Follows,Mad Max Fury Road and It Follows
2015-05-20 19:42:42,1,0,1,It Follows,I loved the babadook I was super hyped on it follows I liked the way it was shot some of the scenes really evoked the feeling of summertime The movie was not scary though and I dont think Ill watch it again
2015-05-20 20:38:22,1,0,1,It Follows,The Babadook was one of my favourite films of 2014 but I didnt find it scary at all I thought It Follows was terrifying
2015-05-21 00:53:58,1,0,1,It Follows,It follows Austin Powers He shags it
2015-05-21 04:38:18,6,0,6,It Follows,It Follows This movie is very rewarding when you pay attention very closely
2015-05-21 04:49:11,2,0,2,It Follows,It Follows and Ex Machina
2015-05-21 09:10:38,3,0,3,It Follows,It Follows actually has quite a lot of scenes take place during the day and theyre still tense
2015-05-21 10:44:50,7,0,7,It Follows,Recently went to the movies and saw It Follows without knowing anything about it and I was blown away by it
2015-05-21 11:40:51,4,0,4,It Follows,Personally if its scary and watchable thats good enough after the disaster that has been the last twenty years of horror movies But if you want something genuinely good go find It Follows
2015-05-21 13:55:05,2,0,2,It Follows,I cant vouch either way as I havent seen Poltergeist yet but it just sounds like more of the same derivative nonsense thats plagued the horror genre for a while Its almost totally bereft of originality with only the occasional exception eg It Follows
2015-05-21 14:36:18,3,0,3,It Follows,Well I tell you what sirmadam When either of the two Mormon owned theaters in my rural area of Washington state decide to pick up the limited release films Id like to see Ill happily pay to see them in theaters I havent seen It Follows yet either never got to see The Raid 2 on a big screen because Fuck foreign movies apparently and the likelihood of them carrying anything of that variety is approximately 0
2015-05-21 15:13:25,-4,0,-4,It Follows,it may fit your agenda but that doesnt mean it follows logically it definitely does not you are too old to play the role of this character who is a 55 year old mans love interest is not the same as you are too old to play the role of a 55 year old mans love interest
2015-05-21 15:20:53,1,0,1,It Follows,Im glad you had that experience because I went into It Follows expecting the horror movie of the decade and I was really disappointed
2015-05-21 17:11:45,1,0,1,It Follows,Well thats the funny thing about evolution is that it doesnt follow what anybody wants or social norms  It follows whatever perpetuates the species  If men lost their drive or were all of a sudden only attracted to older women the species would slowly die out  Its an evolutionary dead end
2015-05-21 17:26:01,1,0,1,It Follows,Mad Max and It Follows Thatd actually be kind of badass
2015-05-21 21:32:20,2,0,2,It Follows,It Follows
2015-05-22 00:53:12,2,0,2,It Follows,It Follows
2015-05-22 03:39:16,-4,0,-4,It Follows,This really isnt creepy thoughthe trailer for it follows was far creepier
2015-05-22 09:39:42,3,0,3,It Follows,I loved Chappie Ex Machina and Mad Max Was disappointed that I missed It Follows in theaters The Avengers was good but I didnt feel like it was essential
2015-05-22 12:53:34,2,0,2,It Follows,Just add it Follows and thats the list right there
2015-05-22 13:13:23,1,0,1,It Follows,It Follows
2015-05-22 15:46:06,1,0,1,It Follows,There was a trilogy of books written following Boba The Bounty Hunter Wars I believe it was named as a whole If anyone likes Boba just based on his appearance in the films then you should definitely check this series out It follows Boba through his exploits leading up to and running parallel to the films Boba is feared and respected throughout the galaxy Thats why we like him so much As to how he became such a figure Gotta read those books
2015-05-22 15:47:59,1,0,1,It Follows,I like your take on it  I initially considered It Followshttpmoviesfilmsandflixcom20150402itfollows2015entrancingandunsettlingthisgrittytimelessfilmservesasapowerfulcautionarymetaphortotheconsequencesofunprotectedsex
2015-05-22 17:20:55,1,0,1,It Follows,I think It Follows is from 2014 Good film regardless
2015-05-23 13:48:52,5,0,5,It Follows,This is a weird answer but the score not soundtrack for It Follows has a VERY 80s vibe
2015-05-23 15:02:08,3,0,3,It Follows,Quite good I think It Follows did a good job of a retro sounding soundtrack
2015-05-23 16:12:15,1,0,1,It Follows,It follows had a very 80s esque soundtrack
2015-05-23 16:17:21,1,0,1,It Follows,Well we know that Mr White from Casino Royale and Quantum of Solace is in the film and we know that it follows on from Skyfall since Moneypenny gives Bond a box from Skyfall
2015-05-23 17:58:35,3,0,3,It Follows,Kinda like Archer It Follows is full of anachronisms both real and fictional to make the time period uncertain
2015-05-24 04:16:46,1,0,1,It Follows,I dont count Youtube when I talk about the film industry  Its not possible  it moves way too fast and it follows its own rules that cant really be cataloged
2015-05-24 11:54:38,1,0,1,It Follows,Damn I dont know which movie it is some WW2 movie but it has the best onetake shot ever It follows a commander around the battle field for a few minutes and goes from regular distance to over other shoulder to a wide view
2015-05-24 17:01:16,23,0,23,It Follows,it follows was insanely good totally blew me away the concept was interesting enough to get me to watch it but fuck the cinematography the soundtrack it really raised the bar in what i expect from horror films
2015-05-24 18:05:32,2,0,2,It Follows,It Follows Score
2015-05-25 03:33:12,3,0,3,It Follows,It Follows I literally JUST said that this movie does for casual walkers what Jaws did to sharks Jesus thats creepy Just like It Follows BTW go see It Follows
2015-05-25 12:21:55,3,0,3,It Follows,as long as it follows its own internal logic somewhat closely i can forgive it so for example everything is made up in star trek and sounds ridiculous but all those ridiculous phrases they use invert the phase inductors follow their own logic so its fine
2015-05-25 16:29:33,19,0,19,It Follows,It Followshttpcdnbloodydisgustingcomwpcontentuploads201503it_follows_ver9_xlg690x1024jpg is exactly that
2015-05-25 17:47:39,3,0,3,It Follows,It followshttpwwwimdbcomtitlett3235888ref_fn_al_tt_1 was a great horror and somewhat unique movie Check it out
2015-05-25 20:34:11,22,0,22,It Follows,David Robert Mitchell would be interesting He did It Follows and that thing was oozing with the kind of dread and atmosphere that It would need
2015-05-25 22:27:10,1,0,1,It Follows,Remakes and sequels are easy money because there is already a fanbase that will want to go see the movie Original movies are hard to market but its not impossible for them to succeed at the box office Hell take a look at It Follows Sure it didnt make the big bucks but it made back more than double its budget John Wick Interstellar Hell just look at the Indie sphere if you want some original flicks Personally I would have seen Tomorrowland if
2015-05-25 22:48:28,16,0,16,It Follows,It to follow It Follows for David Robert Mitchell
2015-05-25 22:48:40,19,0,19,It Follows,It Follows
2015-05-26 01:09:48,1,0,1,It Follows,Death  It follows
2015-05-26 02:05:44,1,0,1,It Follows,It Follows is NOT a good example It was a very bad film
2015-05-26 02:13:01,27,0,27,It Follows,IT follows It Follows
2015-05-26 02:49:19,1,0,1,It Follows,Its more of the latter The movies Ive seen this year in theaters Age of Ultron Fury Road Spongebob 2 Kingsman and It Follows Think thats it besides the obvious Pitch Perfect 2
2015-05-26 03:27:03,1,0,1,It Follows,It Follows
2015-05-26 11:02:38,1,0,1,It Follows,It Follows Just knowing youd be constantly followed by something
2015-05-26 11:42:07,-1,0,-1,It Follows,I didnt like it not the worst film Ive seen though Mad max was way worse It follows was even worse than that Yet all 3 of these films get huge amounts of praise Not sure if the world is just getting dumber or I am becoming a cranky old man
2015-05-26 13:17:03,2,0,2,It Follows,I think that is why The Warriors is a great movie as it follows a similar style
2015-05-26 17:57:53,2,0,2,It Follows,I beloeve the cultured part of the audience you and I along with critics will get tired of it The general audiences wont even connect the proper stuff to realize the meta moments Im sure people were fascinated by 22s meta look towards 21 but I bet when 21 was out the general didnt know squat Same goes for Scream Rise of the Planet of the Apes etc its very sad The worst to get it is horror films I love horror that has something else infused in horrorcomedy horror drama These days films dont know how to be true horror so when things are mixed it makes it easier for everyone you would think But something like Youre Next Cabin in the Woods or It Follows is very meta and pay their homages The general audience doesnt carethey dont think they were scary enough as in jumpscares and bad mouth it So yeah
2015-05-26 18:24:02,2,0,2,It Follows,I understand but i dont want to This couldve been so awesome They just want cheap horror movies that make money Why cant a studio see success in art Especially in todays world where everyone has a voice I know reddit has a lot of love for the modern horror genre sinister conjuring it follows but i just dont share the feeling And i love horror films This project sounded so promising to me
2015-05-26 19:23:45,1,0,1,It Follows,I LOVE Snowpiercer but I dont think it follows the One Sequence action flick  Its one set piece the train but there are definitely lulls in action  This I mean I guess it technically is but after watching Fury Road and Dread I feel it doesnt compare
2015-05-26 19:40:01,1,0,1,It Follows,It Follows new one just coming out on DVD now i think Give it a try its the first truly scary thing Ive seen in ages
2015-05-26 22:38:00,-1,0,-1,It Follows,Except for Ex Machina And Grand Budapest Hotel And It Follows And Interstellar And Her And Tomorrowland And The Babadook And Edge of Tomorrow And Snowpiercer And Crimson Peak And The Machine And Fury And Whiplash
2015-05-27 02:17:25,1,0,1,It Follows,Truth is rMovies circlejerked It Follows as the scariest movie of modern times with links to reviews hailing it as being too scary and Tremendously frightening that when I finally went and seen it by the end of it all I was pissed off Honestly it is original and it is an indie film and I love to show my support to original indies but it was not a scary movie by far The atmosphere is great it is suspenseful very well shot but scary Reddit blew up this movie to the point that I sold others on its unparalleled horror and I felt like an idiot by the end of the second act Good indie film but circlejerked way more than it deserved And if Im being honest here literally everything I just said applies to The Babadook
2015-05-27 02:33:47,0,0,0,It Follows,I second this Great cinematography great premise shit sound quality totally took me out of the movie Sire rmovies hates the third act of insidious but Im going to go out on a limb here and say that so far its scared me more than any other horror film this decade WITH The conjuring following as a close second and sinister as a third It follows Not even in the top 5
2015-05-27 15:41:19,2,0,2,It Follows,Definitely one of the best so far along with Kingsman It Follows and Mad Max Fury Road
2015-05-27 19:41:25,3,0,3,It Follows,Loved this flick me and my bro are horror buffs and we were looking for a copy of it follows but we stumbled upon this gem Although I wouldnt classify it as traditional horror per se it was a great romantic horror film with themes of rebirth and lossThe characters seem authentic and the actress who played Louise is quite captivating hope to see much more of her in the future in movie roles
2015-05-27 19:54:11,2,0,2,It Follows,Agreed It Follows is another great flick Simple but effective
2015-05-27 21:43:31,1,0,1,It Follows,it follows was kind of a spoiler
2015-05-28 04:40:12,3,0,3,It Follows,I know but its still true that most of them are not good So I think critics are rating them fairly Anyway The Babadook and It Follows have much better ratings on RT than IMDB so Im not seeing this bias against horror that the other guy was talking about
2015-05-28 05:29:26,14,0,14,It Follows,It follows It Follows
2015-05-28 07:33:31,2,0,2,It Follows,Love the score idea of not letting the antagonist actually catch you and motifs STD paranoia etcalso love that isnt about jump scares but just the creepinessthey let it flourish I may fidget a bit at jump scares in a theater but afterwards Im not scared It Follows had me legitally spooked like nothing Ive felt before I still get spooked by it sometimes I love itgood 910 for me
2015-05-28 13:10:29,1,0,1,It Follows,I mean Harry Potter isnt in these movies but its in the same universe This one is set in like the 20s in America and it follows Newt Scamander as he presumable gathers information to write his book The Fantastic Beast and Where To Find Them which that book is mentioned in Harry Potter series its one of their school text books
2015-05-28 20:33:06,-3,0,-3,It Follows,It Follows
2015-05-29 03:08:04,3,0,3,It Follows,Cant pick between The Shining Rosemarys Baby and It Follows Im also not a huge horror fan but those three were great films in their own rite
2015-05-29 15:26:46,32,0,32,It Follows,how about IT Follows which cost 2 mil and brought in 20 mil so far  Low risk high reward  And its not a steaming disney turd
2015-05-29 16:43:12,3,0,3,It Follows,I enjoyed It Follows but it still couldve been better I thought The Babadook was really solid though
2015-05-29 17:14:51,11,0,11,It Follows,Interesting I had the opposite viewpoint  I thought the Babadook was average to slightly above and I thought It Follows was a 9 out of 10 for horror movies
2015-05-29 17:51:57,1,0,1,It Follows,I saw John Wick and It Follows based on positive reviews online  I would have never seen either had it not been for positive critical reception and some hype from Reddit
2015-05-29 18:25:25,1,0,1,It Follows,It Follows was so damn good
2015-05-29 19:00:49,3,0,3,It Follows,It Follows made me terrified of people walking at me WALKING I was jittery for like an hour after leaving the theater The babadook made me slightly worried about giving birth to a troubled child
2015-05-29 19:27:17,1,0,1,It Follows,Id add it follows to that list as well   I knew nothing about that movie going to see it and really enjoyed it
2015-05-29 20:23:43,1,0,1,It Follows,As I read more comments I think were all confused at this point haha What I took from the article and what I generally think when people mean original are movies that arent sequels reboots or formulaic Fast and the Furious is an original franchise but if someone else made a movie mostly about car stunts featuring criminals and cops working withagainst each other I dont think people would find it original It follows a formula
2015-05-29 22:01:56,1,0,1,It Follows,The destroyed backyard pool in IT FOLLOWS
2015-05-29 22:24:41,2,0,2,It Follows,Cabin in the Woods Babadook It Follows are the best horror movies to come out this decade IMO
2015-05-29 22:27:08,8,0,8,It Follows,I loved It Followshttpwwwimdbcomtitlett3235888 which came out pretty recently The monster is completely different to any other horror film Ive seen and I thought it was incredibly well done
2015-05-30 00:00:03,1,0,1,It Follows,Martyrs Inside The Babadook It Follows The Orphanage Drag Me to Hell Stake Land The Descent Hard Candy The Loved Ones Frailty The Mist
2015-05-30 10:06:37,2,0,2,It Follows,Its pretty fair Horror as a genre has become really stale and there are very few horror movies that come along and feel fresh and subversive see It Follows And in a horror movie theres a good chance David would be the first one gone
2015-05-30 12:17:55,4,0,4,It Follows,Or disasterpeace after his work on the it follows soundtrack That album is so great
2015-05-31 16:53:10,1,0,1,It Follows,I was too I think there are horror movies that are just meant to be scary on one level and then horror movies that are meant to be scary on two levels both a monster and something more metaphysical It Follows was obviously the later but I felt like it tried so hard to have that metaphysical layer of horror that it forgot to just be a good scary monster movie I think the second layer can be great and make a horror movie even better although a horror movie can be great without it of course but a horror movie needs to first and foremost just be a good scary monster story I think It Follows got so wrapped up in the metaphor it kind of forgot all the other stuff
2015-05-31 18:45:35,27,0,27,It Follows,It Follows
2015-05-31 19:55:19,1,0,1,It Follows,I agree that It Follows is overrated because the characters really got on my nerves especially starting from the pool scene And the girl who read a book the entire movie was so fucking annoying She just complained the entire movie and at the end read a passage to the characters that was not fitting at a ll since it was about death
2015-05-31 20:30:47,2,0,2,It Follows,This has been a slower first half of the year than last year In my opinion Right now my favorite is Me and Earl and the Dying Girl then It Follows
2015-05-31 21:05:14,1,0,1,It Follows,Babadook and It Follows are both pretty great It Follows in particular is a masterpiece
2015-05-31 23:35:57,1,0,1,It Follows,I thought the babadook was pretty good Although I didnt like the implication that the monster did not really exist I think it worked better as a metaphor than a horror movie I watched the evil dead remake earlier It wasnt very good Crimson peak is the next horror movie Im excited for Im also excited for It follows because I havent seen that yet I thought the conjuring was a well made movie but not scary I havent seen insidious although Ive heard good things and I wasnt a fan of Oculus Ive watched Ti West films lately although they are more dramacomedies with horror elements in my opinion but they are enjoyable films They are horror movies in the vain of more of an 80s film Contracted is supposed to be some good body horror Although the concept grosses me out so much Im not sure if I can make it through it
2015-05-31 23:47:42,0,0,0,It Follows,I think the best part of It Follows was the soundtrack people were leaving the theatre I was in and I considered it as well

2015-05-02 00:47:24,2,0,2,Little Boy,Its basically the same movie honestly  Except it doesnt have that kinda weird piece of saying that the vampire is actually a castrated little boy and showing the castrated area
2015-05-02 16:31:44,3,0,3,Little Boy,No they called it Frozen so little boys would want to see it

2015-05-09 02:36:42,4,0,4,Little Boy,the antiNolan folks are like the little boy in the Prestige who cry when the magician doesnt do it the way they want it done  These people want a film but will not listen to the film offered to them its a bubble they live in of their own fantasy of some other film And you listen to them and take them seriously and you discover each one wants a different film  And no matter what film you made the others would still cry because it doesnt fit their unique personal desire  They seem entirely non selfaware of their own subconscious

2015-05-11 15:09:56,11,0,11,Little Boy,Whilst watching this I wondered if this was about that With the little boy trying to deal with the illusions
2015-05-11 20:46:48,-12,0,-12,Little Boy,When Daredevil saved the little boy from the Russians in the second episode  I know youre afraidbut you dont have to be scared anymore ok Im gonna take you back to your dad now

2015-05-12 06:43:54,1,0,1,Little Boy,I used to teach Kindergarten and have taught young people with the exact character traits of this little boy violent and hurtful young people who then amazingly turn on a dime into loving and kindhearted children They generally suffer from some type of trauma They are not bad and they mostly want to just please the adults in their life but they have zero coping mechanisms to deal with darker desires when they arise I get the kid and completely recognized his character Also after long parent teacher conferences I sympathized entirely with the mom The struggle is real Word
2015-05-12 23:41:23,1,0,1,Little Boy,Whoa thats actually a pretty good catch I definitely remember seeing the tall guy during the beach scene but I had no idea that the little boy was suppose to be the same kid from earlier in the moviethat totally makes sense Especially considering the fact that he was trying to sneak a peak earlier in the movie thats actually a really nice subtle detail that Im willing to bet a lot of people didnt even realize Good stuff
2015-05-13 00:25:11,31,0,31,Little Boy,The first time I can remember being mesmerized by a woman was seeing Cameron Diaz in The Mask I think thats when she looked her best and I was a smitten little boy lol
2015-05-13 16:50:51,1,0,1,Little Boy,I wasnt prepared for that  The girl that got me to watch it knew how it end  Being a single father of a little boy and not having a relationship with my dad oh man I was not ready for that
2015-05-14 21:08:24,-1,0,-1,Little Boy,I just watched this yesterday I completely agree with you and SPPPOILERRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRR I thought to myself in the middle of it Hey this kid should be about 13 or so right about now So I googled him if I could see what he looked like now Then the way I felt after I read what she did to that little boy I didnt know how he could carry on and finish this documentary But beautifully he changed the dedication to Dear David and Kate I have never been so emotional during a doc I want to watch it again But I dont want to put myself through that again
2015-05-14 21:49:32,4,0,4,Little Boy,Most recently Wild The scene where the little boy sings her Red River Valley really hit me hard
2015-05-15 22:44:42,1,0,1,Little Boy,Also in a cinema a few towns over I saw Half Blood Prince on opening day Just after the fade when Dumbledore falls from the tower a little boy at the front says to his mum is he dead and the theatre erupts into laugher

2015-05-17 07:05:20,1,0,1,Little Boy,I went to one theater and the audio wasnt working so I eventually went to another From what I saw of the credits at the first one they were going in and out and skipping as the employees tried to fix the sound there was Little Boy and Fantastic Four they may have shown something else but I cant remember At the other theater the previews I remember are Fantastic Four and Vacation like the National Lampoon one but with Ed Helms and Christina Applegate No Batman vs Superman in either
2015-05-18 07:23:51,0,0,0,Little Boy,Im always surprised to see that Heart IsHearty Pawshttpwwwimdbcomtitlett1710565 is never on these lists Its a fantastically depressing drama about a little boy who steals a puppy for his sister after their parents abandon them Great movie You will cry
2015-05-18 07:29:18,1,0,1,Little Boy,Aha this would be the perfect thread for my question I once saw a Korean movie about a depressed guy living in his apartment He is haunted by ghosts who want him to fulfill their desires for example there is a little boy who wants nothing more than one of those caramel fish from a street vendor Its a dramacomedy does anybody know the name of this movie
2015-05-18 13:47:02,2,0,2,Little Boy,It wasnt scary at all The acting was okay at best   The actress who played the mother was good  but the little boy was unlikable throughout I know it was praised for its symbolism  but I felt like they were hitting the viewer over the head with it

2015-05-20 02:24:14,1,0,1,Little Boy,That little boy is narcoticly uncharismatic
2015-05-22 15:50:08,16,0,16,Little Boy,I dont see a lot of people talking about this throughline so I mean I hope Im not crazy But yeah to me the movie pretty clearly sets up an age appropriate romance that becomes age inappropriate as the little boy ages 40 years and the little girl stays 12 I dont feel like I am clever and found some kind of subtext its pretty explicitly stated in the movie I swear in the present day grumpy midfifties Clooney is telling the heroine why she shouldnt trust Athena and he cuts himself off from saying Robots cant love

2015-05-23 18:13:27,-2,0,-2,Little Boy,The problem here is that some people do see it in that weird sort of way If you have some people in the theatre all of sudden feeling uncomfortable and weirded out then you have a serious problem with how it is presented I think they should have shown her flash back but then when they cut back to clooney have the little boy actor sitting there That way they could really hammer home the young lovefriendship thing But instead its old clooney and some people are like what the fuck
2015-05-26 06:32:41,0,0,0,Little Boy,They are stoic though  theyre Jedi Come on Neeson was nowhere near underacting in this film I would say hes a kind of fatherfigure yes at least a guardian to a little boy who finds himself stranded amongst a surrogate family that is initially hostile and doesnt think he should be there That lays the foundation for his repressed hatred of the Jedi 2 films later
2015-05-27 15:47:59,-6,0,-6,Little Boy,I felt it shouldve had more gore like Ive seen PG13 movies with more blood and this was supposed to be R Also I didnt care for the visions Max had throughout the film mostly because they didnt make sense and werent explained If it had been a little boy in all the visions perfect its his son makes sense But instead its a little girl that weve never met with no introduction no explanation and it just felt cheesy
2015-05-27 17:52:29,0,0,0,Little Boy,The reason I said that was due to the fact that I first watched it when I was a little boy and at that age everything will look amazing to you but by the time I rewatched it as an adult I did so with a more critical eye and that made me realize that its not the flawless movie I made it out to be I still had fun watching it but I was certainly aware of its flaws Id probably wouldnt have watched it if it had been released today but it still holds a dear place in my memory
2015-05-28 11:48:40,0,0,0,Little Boy,ive heard this fan theory that Mad Max is sort of like an identity like James Bond and it refers to a couple different Maxes than just one IT would make the most sense tying 2 and 3 together the Max in 3 is just the little savage boy from 2 who grew up emulating this superhero figure that saved him as a little boy if you look both the child in 2 and Max in 3 have the SAME EXACT WHITE STREAK IN THEIR HAIR Plus assuming this new identity helps them escape their previous life theyre trying to get away from

2015-05-03 00:25:33,14,0,14,The Connection,People think that Brands rant about love being a quantifiable artifact of a higher dimension as being the truth behind the movie but it isnt  Cooper calls her crazy and the audience is meant to agree She is wrong But the connection of love is what is used for Cooper to connect with the past in the Tesseract Not because love did it but the symbol of the father daughter relationship was strong enough for the bulk beings to see it as a reliable method of getting Cooper to relay the quantum data to the past Brands rant is meant to be seen as crazy
2015-05-03 15:55:02,1,0,1,The Connection,I dont know why you are being downvoted The Lego Movie is essentially The Matrix for kids Loner gets contacted by mysterious girl in all black the interrogation scene train track fighting scene he goes into a hole that takes him to a new world the prophecy for the One or the Special Enters main dudes mind for training Theres his epic fail in front of his peers the police busting in the hostage situation the plan to attack the headquarters minor characters sorta brainwashed chosen one dies sentinels that look super similar in both movies come out hero isnt dead Comes back with new moves baddie blows up spider sentinel robot things drop like flies chosen one and girl hook up I dont see how people miss the connections
2015-05-04 19:45:13,3,0,3,The Connection,Im inclined to agree Marvel loves to hype the its all connected stuff but the connections are largely superficial and they get cold feet when it comes to making truly meaningful connections between the MCU movies because they know that the viewers who havent seen all the other MCU movies are going to whine about how they didnt understand some particular plot point and rate the movie lower as a result To my mind its like walking into Return of the Jedi and whining about how the movie actually expects you to know what happened in The Empire Strikes back but hey whiners gonna whine
2015-05-05 04:53:30,2,0,2,The Connection,Oh I wasnt disagreeing I was meaning its weird how everyone sees the connection Even though they arent related werent marketed as such and came out a year apart
2015-05-05 16:49:56,2,0,2,The Connection,FWIW I really liked ST12 and strongly disliked TSN The connection is that theyre both comingofage movies released around the same time

2015-05-06 18:24:38,1,0,1,The Connection,Its an interesting novel but the directors thriller film The Connection was kind of boring
2015-05-06 20:11:58,2,0,2,The Connection,Hi  Yeah its my own dopey observation  I was just surfing YouTube and came across a Gerry Anderson Thunderbirds episode upload where the very first shot I saw reminded me of Wes aesthetic  After about the ninth or tenth shotsimilarity in the next few minutes the connection seemed if not actual and likely certainly wonderfully coincidental
2015-05-06 20:15:29,1,0,1,The Connection,How do people feel about What Dreams May Come as a depiction of depression  The connection with Robin Williams and the subject matter of that movie make it thought provoking

2015-05-09 05:31:21,-7,0,-7,The Connection,This is essentially a Hillary Clinton campaign ad Im sure itll be released some time in 2016 right in the middle of the presidential election Itll help to make voters aware of Ginsberg and her pending retirement from the supreme court Thats not by accident Portman is a liberal Democrat Ill bet she endorses Hillary too just to make sure people get the connection

2015-05-11 21:14:18,1,0,1,The Connection,its fun to watch Hidden Fortress as a Jidageki Star Wars  the connection is clearly there and easy to see but what Kurosawa does in his movie is just fantastic  There are a few humor bits that are really funny too
2015-05-11 21:15:23,1,0,1,The Connection,Okay I had a hard time seeing the connection Ive never actually heard someone complain about Prim being black

2015-05-12 17:26:30,2,0,2,The Connection,Thats exactly what I came here to say I was wondering if anyone else saw the connection
2015-05-12 22:38:54,1,0,1,The Connection,But immediately after Brand says love can transcend spacetime the rest of the characters call her wrong And she is wrong At the end when love transcends spacetime in the Tesseract  it isnt love its the connection between father and daughter that the bulk beings bargained on being a reliable method of transferring the quantum data back through time So the love transcends spacetime isnt meant to be literal

2015-05-18 04:38:51,1,0,1,The Connection,The film wanted to imply a connection between the subversive Dietrich amp V but the connection is more about the simple gentilities of English life amp traditions before the new fascist state such as making Eve a classic English breakfast dish

2015-05-19 03:55:41,4,0,4,The Connection,I think you have to be introduced to this movie when you are young One of the main parts of it is the kids pretty much telling the adults to shove it it is easy to understand the point as an adult but I definitely dont think I would have the connection to it that I do if I hadnt seen it as early as I did
2015-05-19 18:18:44,10,0,10,The Connection,Love is not the answer its the means Her monologue was one of an irrational desperate lover seeking her partner We learn after the tesseract that the connection between humans is what defines us and that love in this case between a father and daughter is what connected two beings as a means to a solution

2015-05-25 22:19:31,9,0,9,The Connection,Sorry but we are talking about one of the greatest novels of the 20th century If you think the movie ending is better not better for the movie just better you are missing much of the novels message Credit to uMorris_Night for pointing out the connection between the squid and the theme of suppressing art in a time of fear in a previous post
2015-05-26 07:36:48,2,0,2,The Connection,Speaking on how less than 5 of the population of America are in fact gay it is no surprise that the heterosexual majority being almost everybody would make the connection between a male and female rather than a male and male or female and female This has nothing to do with rejection its natural to think this way its instinctual
2015-05-26 19:56:27,46,0,46,The Connection,Woah I never made the connection that the villains represent the stages of humanitys downfall Intentional or not its a pretty cool detail
2015-05-27 16:40:29,1,0,1,The Connection,Whats the connection to Penny Dreadful Why do I keep seeing it come up in the comments
2015-05-28 16:18:20,2,0,2,The Connection,Ahh I see I get the real life concept I just couldnt make the connection
2015-05-28 16:20:19,1,0,1,The Connection,Dont really see the connection
2015-05-28 18:56:12,1,0,1,The Connection,A Serious Man A tornado bellowing toward the town a phone call we never hear finish money that needs to pay back Just when the connections start to come the credits just cut in
2015-05-29 17:17:32,3,0,3,The Connection,I can see how the connection could be made but I wouldnt really compare the two Although both characters are certainly socially skewed to a degree they are very different from each other
2015-05-29 20:31:42,3,0,3,The Connection,I like how George Miller doesnt throw it in your face either He lets you make the connections without blatantly saying it
2015-05-29 20:51:08,2,0,2,The Connection,I never heard the connection and although I cant find a source other than Wiki which youre rightnot always the best source on an implicit connection the article from allears suggests the idea might have come from Walts involvement with a Cold War era type of organization  It would make sense even though the company was focused on entertainment Walt was more politically motivated than the company is today
2015-05-30 22:16:41,1,0,1,The Connection,I like the family thing I think we could have focused more on the emotions of the developing android but I dont like the connection the human feels Maybe Im just cold hearted but my love is not that easy and its a robot I guess thats why he was chosen because he was a sap Now that makes me even more perturbed why the hell was the genius trying to play match maker is sexual longing really the most powerful connection that he wanted to establish
2015-05-31 17:06:15,1,0,1,The Connection,Never made the connection but this is pretty close to the interpretation of the God of War in Azerellos Wonder Woman comic books Hes barefoot in a white linen suit and his feet are soaked in blood
2015-05-05 01:14:34,1,0,1,Black or White,More like antiheroes Its more grey then it is black or white good or bad Thats what makes it interesting though
2015-05-13 10:19:58,4,0,4,Black or White,Everyone in A Seperationhttpwwwimdbcomtitlett1832382  No one is black or white everyone lies everyone is human and complex Only movie in my lifetime where I have seen a parent and a child talk about whether its appropriate to lie about something serious to protect someone and it wasnt handled like some sort of a joke
2015-05-17 03:54:29,1,0,1,Black or White,1 So I get what your saying but there are tons of arguments and debates over morality right and wrong ect on the internet  One would think there would be enough to atleast put the notion that killing isnt a black or white subject  And sure there is plenty of killing of lesser creatures without remorse but there is plenty of people that it affects deeply as wellsee vegans  I dont know she could have reasoned that it was in her best interest to kill or be killed but I would still expect some sort of emotional response  Hmmmunless there were no emotions to begin with
2015-05-17 18:25:43,13,0,13,Black or White,Yes The movie didnt seem to know what it wanted to be Did it want to be America fuck yeah Lets Kell some terrorists or did it want to delve into PTSD It did a terrible job presenting mental health In most cases PTSD isnt black or white and solved over night like the movie portrayed I wish the focus of the movie was on his mental health and family relationships because those were its strongest scenes
2015-05-26 21:37:17,3,0,3,Black or White,Not exactly The movie to me preaches in grays rather than black or white Not Capitalism is literally satan but not Buy everything its all you need either More like Things wont make you happy they just tell you they will I find it ironic how many people miss the message whether theyre starting their own fight clubs or trying to blow shit up Project Mayhem style I think ultimately the movie tells you that neither extreme like Jack at the beginning of the movie or Tyler by the end of the film is correct and that you have to find a happy medium
2015-05-28 02:21:25,0,0,0,Black or White,I know I was being facetious And Jesus was not black or white either
2015-05-10 05:52:55,1,0,1,Aloha,Aloha Mr Grey
2015-05-12 10:18:54,0,0,0,Aloha,Just wait until Aloha comes out this month It is going to be very insulting
2015-05-17 07:09:41,5,0,5,Aloha,ALOHA SNACKBAR
2015-05-18 14:02:53,1,0,1,Aloha,Id have to say Aloha I feel like I may not actually like the movie that much but the soundtrack and editing in the trailer is flawless
2015-05-20 04:32:05,2,0,2,Aloha,Shes in the upcoming Cameron Crowe film Aloha
2015-05-21 12:22:24,1,0,1,Aloha,If I had to pick a film coming out during that timespan then it would be Aloha because I am a sucker for Cameron Crowe But in reality I will probably be seeing Mad Max Fury Road again
2015-05-21 20:40:50,21,0,21,Aloha,In Forgetting Sarah Marshall the had speaking roles for Hawaiians and Asians In the Descendants they had speaking parts for Asians and Hawaiians and the original story was written by a local Hawaiian In Aloha supposedly there are no or little speaking parts for Hawaiians or Asians Also to use a Hawaiian word to promote a movie is disrespectful and a lie during the filming they called it An Untitled Carmerone Crowe project or Paradise
2015-05-21 20:42:52,12,0,12,Aloha,The Descendants had a few Asian characters and the original story was written by a local Hawaiian women The Descendants also showed contemporary Island life far more realistically than almost all other movies EDIT On IMDB the top 15 actors in Aloha 14 are white and 1 is black
2015-05-21 21:14:15,9,0,9,Aloha,I look for films to be fair to the people theyre representing If you make a movie called Aloha shot in Hawaii and you dont have any Hawaiians in the film that is fucked up
2015-05-22 04:00:38,-1,0,-1,Aloha,Cameron Crowe writes and directs films that speaks to me There is a certain melancholia in the way he views the world that tugs at my heartstrings I dont care what the critics say  I know Aloha will be good
2015-05-22 04:12:55,5,0,5,Aloha,I dont think Ive ever been less interested in seeing a film than I am in seeing Aloha Aloha looks like the blandest film ever made
2015-05-23 04:53:30,1,0,1,Aloha,Except for Aloha i like the list
2015-05-23 20:32:45,1,0,1,Aloha,From all the news surrounding Aloha it sounds like its pretty bad Although the trailer looked really good and it is Cameron Crowe film so Im gonna see it anyways I still have hope that its gonna be really good
2015-05-24 10:41:10,1,0,1,Aloha,Bill Murray has been directed by Sofia Coppola Lost In Translation Jim Jarmusch Broken Flowers Sydney Pollack Tootsie Harold Ramis Groundhog Day Tim Burton Ed Wood George Clooney The Monuments Men Wes Anderson The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou and Cameron Crowe Aloha
2015-05-25 02:16:09,1,0,1,Aloha,Real question here is how was Aloha
2015-05-25 06:40:25,1,0,1,Aloha,I saw a commercial for Aloha the other day and it had a voiceover Thought it was weird because I havent heard one in a movie ad in a while
2015-05-26 20:58:13,2,0,2,Aloha,What about Alohahttpwwwimdbcomtitlett1243974ref_nm_flmg_act_6 the new film from Cameron Crowe Featuring Bradley Cooper Emma Stone and Bill Murray among others if you like Crowes previous work then it should be worth getting excited about
2015-05-27 06:34:52,1,0,1,Aloha,Hawaii 50 isnt based on a military base They did go off the base on Aloha sometimes but this is being exaggerated If anything there were black people missing
2015-05-27 16:21:19,5,0,5,Aloha,This movie was also constantly pushed back and didnt even have a title for the majority of its production The inspired Aloha was chosen after the film had finished wrapping Usually not great signs either especially when you also factor in the critic embargo Basically it sounds like the studio knows it has a dud Unfortunate because the cast is pretty fantastic but Crowe seems to have lost most of his charm and magic lately as this seems a lot more like Elizabethtown then it does Almost Famous
2015-05-27 20:57:47,1,0,1,Aloha,Aloha
2015-05-28 20:13:33,1,0,1,Aloha,Aloha uNerdtronix
2015-05-28 20:35:26,3,0,3,Aloha,Heh Currently on RT We Bought a Zoo has a 66 fresh score Whereas Aloha has a 10 rotten score
2015-05-28 21:04:18,43,0,43,Aloha,gtCrowe may have had us at hello but hes losing us with Aloha
2015-05-28 21:28:59,7,0,7,Aloha,I dunno I find Aloha being shredded by critics to be at least a bit surprising
2015-05-28 23:36:18,3,0,3,Aloha,Right now it is that Emma Stone plays Allison Ng in Aloha I guess that is one Asian in the movie after all
2015-05-29 00:35:28,1,0,1,Aloha,Agreed The quality of his past work certainly doesnt give him a pass on the new stuff but theres still the hint of his charm in Elizabethtown and We Bought A Zoo that makes it worth a ticket  While I wish that Aloha was a return to form it doesnt appear thats the case but Id still watch a mediocre Cameron Crowe movie over a lot of other shit out there
2015-05-29 02:04:48,8,0,8,Aloha,Me too Almost Famous is my favorite movie I wanted Aloha to be crowes return to form so badly
2015-05-29 10:17:05,2,0,2,Aloha,Just wait till you see Aloha
2015-05-29 18:03:02,2,0,2,Aloha,I support good movies not just original ones Mad Max Fury Road was a rebootsequelremakeit is really unclear how this film relates to the other films but it is the best movie I have seen all year Being original is not the same thing as being good Tomorrowland is not the only original film playing right now There is also the Rocks San Andreas Rotten Tomatoes rate it 51 2 higher than Tomorrowland andAloha which is only 14
2015-05-29 21:31:12,0,0,0,Aloha,Except Aloha is goodhttpscotthollerancommoviesmoviereviewaloha
2015-05-29 21:44:04,0,0,0,Aloha,I havent seen the movie but its currently rocking an 18 on rotten tomatoeshttpwwwrottentomatoescommaloha_2015  It has about 50 from fan ratings but it just came out today so that probably doesnt mean much right now
2015-05-30 06:01:21,1,0,1,Aloha,Heres the one about Aloha specficallyhttpdefamergawkercomleakedemailscameroncrowesnewbradleycoopermovie16709638151707724841
2015-05-30 17:01:14,7,0,7,Aloha,Aloha missed the train
2015-05-30 17:26:52,217,0,217,Aloha,Aloha has a weird trailer I couldnt get a grasp on the type of movie it is People dont like Bradleys character because he is a mysterious loner except for  Emma Suddenly they are in Hawaii with Bill Murray doing something
2015-05-30 17:47:51,39,0,39,Aloha,Aloha wasnt that great so I am not surprised at all Goes to show that you can have an amazing cast INCLUDING BILL MURRAY and still have a movie that is not very good due to a terrible script  lots of reediting and cutting of footage
2015-05-30 17:48:20,2,0,2,Aloha,Almost Famous was his fourth major film He also made Jerry McGuire and Vanilla Sky which Im not too fond of but he also made Singles which many of my friends havent heard of and he made Say Anything I thought We Bought a Zoo was charming enough not great but not bad I havent seen Aloha yet but he has definitely made more good films than bad So I wouldnt say he has lost his path I just think people have too high of expectations
2015-05-30 18:00:32,1,0,1,Aloha,He also made Elizabethtown which is a major major bore I really liked Vanilla Sky but not to be that guy but I like the original version better But Sky is still great Now Almost FamousI think is overrated Not a bad movie by any means but not great just good Singles I saw when I was younger and found it boring Zoo I thought it was okay but thats the problem Jerry and Say Anything were so damn good plus Fast Times too that I would expect he would be one of our best directors now Aloha looks like garbage and is getting reviews like it
2015-05-30 18:48:50,33,0,33,Aloha,No fucking doubt When I read the headline I was like What is Aloha
2015-05-30 19:02:03,1,0,1,Aloha,Aloha Aloha
2015-05-30 19:04:28,1,0,1,Aloha,Aloha isnt nearly as bad as the negative reviews would have you believe And I kind of wish Id ignored the tepid press for We Bought a Zoo Watched it for the first time a few days ago and enjoyed it very much Really the only film of Crowes I dont much care for is Elizabethtown and even then Id be willing to watch it again to see if I feel differently about it
2015-05-30 19:32:48,-19,0,-19,Aloha,gtAnd yup Hawaiis population is totally reminiscent of the 99 white cast in Aloha Totally not a valid complaint
2015-05-30 19:49:36,2,0,2,Aloha,No surprise there Rock is way too big now to have a movie fail Aloha is its a mess Crowe hasnt done anything good in a while Zoo was okay but thats just about it  it was okay and nothing more Im just glad that Mad Max managed to cross 100 million milestone domestic before San Andreas came on
2015-05-30 19:52:23,25,0,25,Aloha,TIL Aloha is a movie
2015-05-30 19:58:12,10,0,10,Aloha,Conveniently if you say Aloha to Crowes new flick you are both welcoming it and dismissing it from the theaters
2015-05-30 20:37:55,3,0,3,Aloha,Doesnt surprise me The only thing I heard about Aloha was how whitey white white it was whereas for San Andreas Ive seen trailers for it in theaters Also The Rock
2015-05-30 20:40:37,31,0,31,Aloha,Being from Hawaii I loved The Descendants and thought it captured Hawaii more authentically than any other movie thats been set in Hawaii and I thought Clooney did a great job and was very convincing in his role Also the Descendants recognized its whiteness you could say and it was actually an important part of the movie Aloha is just a messy movie that captures the touristy perspective of Hawaii in an unauthentic way
2015-05-30 20:50:01,1,0,1,Aloha,Its not very good but it has a nice positivity to it Its harmless with rounded edges and lots of sentimentality and gazinga great date movie I know most men on reddit would prefer their datesGFs to want to see Mad Max Fury Road but if youre going to spend 2 hours staring at a screen in silence on a date go with Aloha Just try not to roll your eyes and groan too loudly
2015-05-30 20:55:36,6,0,6,Aloha,Unless theres another controversy Im unaware of the two big issues with Aloha is that Crowe paints a Hawaii that is predominantly white when in fact Hawaii is 14 white at best 247 as of 2010 according to Wiki
2015-05-30 21:06:23,2,0,2,Aloha,Actually weve both seen Mad Max already haha She picked Aloha because its the only recent big film she hasnt seen
2015-05-30 21:22:52,132,0,132,Aloha,It really isnt Ive lived on the big island my whole life and everyone is accepted here You hear about the racists a lot but for every one dumb Haole hating local there are 100 genuine good hearted people who would give you the shirt off their back regardless of what you look like or where you come from As silly as it sounds we take Aloha very seriously here From a young age kids are taught to love one another Please dont judge an entire culture based off a few peoples accounts or maybe a bad experience you had
2015-05-30 22:14:11,3,0,3,Aloha,Or you can look at the fact that Mad Max was up against another big summer opener in Pitch Perfect  San Andreas didnt have anything but Aloha opening against it
2015-05-30 22:27:58,11,0,11,Aloha,Exactly not the Aloha heres a lei and a pineapple brudda unconditional love paradise it has a hollywood reputation for Its a real place with real history that gets glossed over a lot
2015-05-30 22:33:30,2,0,2,Aloha,gtMeanwhile Alohas already caught heat from Native Hawaiians and Pacific Islanders for appropriating its title from a word laden with meaning and history The outraged should be more incensed that for a movie set in Hawaii there are precious few nonwhite faces onscreen
2015-05-30 22:41:32,9,0,9,Aloha,Haole means without the breath Ha is the breath of life that the native Hawaiians carried but the foreigners did not Ha is also found in aloha which means to share the breath
2015-05-30 22:47:27,1,0,1,Aloha,My take on Aloha before seeing it
2015-05-30 22:57:34,1,0,1,Aloha,Aloha David England checking in
2015-05-30 23:19:13,7,0,7,Aloha,No I would call a movie that takes place in Hawaii with the Hawaiian name Aloha where all speaking characters and 99 of background characters are white in a state where only 30 of the people are white a whitewashed film
2015-05-30 23:27:17,-9,0,-9,Aloha,gt No I would call a movie that takes place in Hawaii with the Hawaiian name Aloha where all speaking characters and 99 of background characters are white in a state where only 30 of the people are white a whitewashed film
2015-05-30 23:51:16,9,0,9,Aloha,The Boston Globe reviewhttpswwwbostonglobecomartsmovies20150528alohadoesnsayanythingworthwhilec9BHoTKZDuw0ASeo6HznYJstoryhtml says that shes supposed to be onequarter Hawaiian and onequarter Chinese
2015-05-31 00:42:41,4,0,4,Aloha,Huh The authors saying that people should be more outraged about the primarily white cast than they should about Aloha being the title Theyre not saying people should be more outraged than they would about any other possible thing that could conceivably have happened in the film Its about that one specific example
2015-05-31 01:18:42,-10,0,-10,Aloha,If a black writerdirector wrote a story about black characters in Hawaii would the writer take such umbrage Obviously of course not White people are supposed to loathe themselves because their ancestors I guess This is petty crap Take a look at the world the hell holes child sex slavery genital mutilations genocides ecocide and of course Cameron Crowe making a racist movie which is racist because he is white the characters are white and they are in Hawaii Imagine the title The Unbearable Blackness of Tyler Perrys Aloha Fuck that
2015-05-31 01:43:35,1,0,1,Aloha,who ever thought Aloha was a good idea after American Hustle is an idiot
2015-05-31 02:26:05,1,0,1,Aloha,What the hell is Aloha
2015-05-31 02:35:58,1,0,1,Aloha,I recently hit the back button on a video I wanted to watch because the Aloha trailer was about to play and I couldnt put myself through another 5 seconds of it before the skip became available
2015-05-31 06:11:50,11,0,11,Aloha,Mad Max is very good because the camera cuts allow the action to flow with the story like reading a comic book with good panel artwork Each scene leads into the next unlike Aloha
2015-05-31 07:47:22,9,0,9,Aloha,The writer points out that Aloha is a cultural phrase with deep historical meaning and shouldnt be used as a movie title cause making it commercialized would be wrong
2015-05-31 11:09:18,1,0,1,Aloha,we talking about Elizabethtown We bought a Zoo or Alohai count 3 mediocre to bad movies
2015-05-31 11:42:06,1,0,1,Aloha,I wonder if the ages of cooper and stone were as off putting to others as it was to me she is 26 and he is 40 while not the largest gap in the world i have a vision in my head of the ages of these 2 actors and as a result cant really see the 2 of them making sense in any way shape or form many are stating aloha had shit script and whatnot but that doesnt really mean that on opening people wont want to go see it
2015-05-31 19:02:26,2,0,2,Aloha,Aloha will free up a lot of screens for Max
